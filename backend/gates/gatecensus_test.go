package gates

// The census over this repo's own gate machinery: a gate's exceptions are held
// to the standard the gate holds its subjects to.
//
// gatekit gives a waiver two obligations — state what it costs, and describe
// code that still exists — and enforces both. A map declared beside a gate
// instead of inside gatekit has neither: it reads as a ratified exception while
// certifying nothing, and it is one `var` away from every gate in the tree. The
// three rules here derive the population from the tree rather than tracking it
// as a list, so the next declaration inherits the obligation:
//
//   - a package-level map from subject to reason, in a test file, is either a
//     gatekit.Waivers set or a declared fixture;
//   - every waiver set is swept for staleness from exactly one place;
//   - nothing but a test reaches the waiver machinery at all.
