// AGENTS.md is the rulebook — at the root, and in any directory that needs one of
// its own. The CLAUDE.md beside it contains one line, `@AGENTS.md`, and nothing
// else. It exists only because Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md and never AGENTS.md.
//
// Keeping the shim empty is the whole rule, and it is stricter than it looks
// because the alternative fails silently. A rule written into a CLAUDE.md binds
// Claude Code and no other harness: the craftsmanship gate walks up for the
// nearest AGENTS.md and never opens CLAUDE.md, so that rule cannot reach it, and
// neither file looks wrong. An empty shim cannot hold a rule at all, which is
// why the assertion is "nothing but the import" rather than a heading census or
// a size ceiling — those admit the paragraph that is not quite a rule yet, and
// they need a hand-written list of what a rule looks like, which is itself a
// second copy of the rulebook's table of contents.
//
// Both assertions derive their subjects from the tree: the pairs come from
// walking for AGENTS.md. A directory that grows a rulebook tomorrow is enrolled
// the moment it exists, and there is no list here to go short.
