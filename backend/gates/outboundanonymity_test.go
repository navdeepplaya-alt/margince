// Every outbound HTTP request either says who is calling, or is registered as
// deliberately anonymous with the reason.
//
// The sibling gate next door (TestNoOutboundIdentityIsWrittenAtItsCallSite)
// holds the calls that DECLARE something to one spelling. It has nothing to say
// about a call that declares nothing, and it cannot: a gate over the source can
// see a wrong header and not an absent one — unless it goes looking, which is
// what this does.
//
// A request with no User-Agent is not anonymous. Go supplies
// `Go-http-client/1.1`, which names the language runtime and nothing about who
// is calling or why, and it is what 23 live paths in this tree were sending. A
// remote operator diagnosing that traffic can block a language or nothing.
//
// NOT every call needs a name, and the register is where that is said rather
// than assumed. A token-authenticated provider API already knows exactly who is
// calling — the credential says so — and a request to this product's own origin
// is talking to itself. What the register is for is the DIFFERENCE between a
// call somebody decided needs no identity and one nobody thought about, which
// is invisible in the code either way.
