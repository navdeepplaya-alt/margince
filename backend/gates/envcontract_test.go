// Environment-variable contract fitness functions. Four obligations, all
// derived from the tree rather than a maintained list:
//
//  1. every MARGINCE_* var the Go code reads is named in
//     docs/reference/configuration.md — the table of record for the binaries;
//  2. every MARGINCE_* var .env.example names is still part of the product;
//  3. every MARGINCE_* var configuration.md names is still part of the product;
//  4. every MARGINCE_* var a deploy entrypoint hard-requires is named in
//     .env.example — that file is the annotated template docs/deployment.md
//     hands an operator, so a var the container refuses to boot without must
//     not be discoverable only by reading the entrypoint script.
//
// Unasserted, the three files drift apart: the template names credentials for a
// process role that no longer exists, a secret an operator must provision goes
// undocumented, and the reference doc keeps a row for a variable nothing reads.
// None of those is visible at the point of failure — an operator supplies a
// value and observes no effect, or looks for a variable and does not find it.
//
// What these gates do NOT cover, stated rather than implied:
//
//   - Obligation 1 covers Go readers, in the licensed trees only. A var read
//     solely by deploy shell or a workflow is documented in docs/deployment.md
//     by hand, and this sweep walks the backend tree only.
//     Obligations 2 and 3 do count those non-Go readers, because there the
//     question is merely whether a name is still real.
//   - MARGINCE_-prefixed names only. The BYOK keys (GEMINI_API_KEY,
//     OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY) carry
//     provider-conventional names and are ungated. Widening the pattern to any
//     env-shaped literal would match unrelated constants and trade a sharp
//     gate for a noisy one.
//   - Whole double-quoted literals only. A name assembled at run time
//     ("MARGINCE_" + provider + "_KEY"), or written as a backquoted raw string,
//     is invisible to every obligation here, so adding one has to be a
//     deliberate act rather than a silent gap.
//     internal/platform/config/unknown.go is the one deliberate case: it
//     assembles the names of variables it deliberately does NOT read, so a
//     whole literal there would demand a documentation row for a variable no
//     process consults. Its own comment records the reason. Every backquoted
//     occurrence remains prose in a comment or an error message.
//   - Presence, not truth. A var being named in a document does not make the
//     prose around it accurate, and .env.example now carries denser
//     behavioural claims than the reference doc does. These gates stop a var
//     disappearing; they cannot stop a description going stale.
