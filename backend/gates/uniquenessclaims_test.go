//gate:kind claim H1

package gates

// A comment that says a declaration is the ONLY one of its kind is not
// decoration. It is what stops the next author looking — they grep, they find
// the claim, and they stop. So a false one is worse than silence: silence at
// least leaves the search on.
//
// This tree's own rulebook already says so, in `Reuse before you build`:
// "a comment may not claim to be the only implementation unless a test holds
// it. If no test fails when a second one appears, delete the claim or write the
// test." That has been instruction for a while, and instruction was not enough:
// a sweep audited ten such claims exhaustively and NINE were false. Among
// them:
//
//   - "the only definition of a current employment in this product" — eight
//     compose sites spelled the predicate by hand, which is the exact
//     notice-period bug the comment said it existed to prevent.
//   - "the one spelling every table uses" for a credential handle — there were
//     three, and the two the sweep missed carried ciphertext past a wipe.
//   - "the ONE way a caught failure becomes words on a screen" — five screens
//     bypassed it, and one of them put an RBAC object and verb in front of a
//     user.
//
// None of those was found by a gate. Every one was found by a human re-reading
// a file for some other reason, months later.
//
// The class is broader than prose, and the sharpest example is one rung more
// concrete: an e2e spec asserted the relink search box reads "Person,
// Organisation, Deal, Lead oder Projekt suchen". Projects joined the searchable
// kinds, the string grew a fifth, and nothing derived either the sentence or
// the spec's copy of it from the set they both describe. It surfaced five
// merges later, in an unrelated lane.
//
// So the rule below is about claims that nothing HOLDS, not about comments
// specifically: a literal asserting a set's contents with no deriver is the
// same defect as a uniqueness comment with no test behind it.
//
// THIS GATE DOES NOT AUDIT THE CLAIMS. It cannot: whether a claim is true is a
// question about the whole tree, and the tree holds hundreds of them. What it
// does is make the class stop GROWING, which is the half a test can hold:
//
//   - A claim that names its gate is held. `Held by: Test… (path)` in the
//     same doc comment, and this file checks that test exists.
//   - Every other claim in the tree today is in `uniquenessclaims.txt`, which
//     is a DEBT REGISTER and not a permission. It can only shrink: a claim that
//     is not in it and does not name a gate fails, so a NEW claim must be held
//     the day it is written.
//   - An entry that has stopped matching a real claim fails too, so the
//     register tracks the tree rather than rotting beside it.
//
// CLOSED TO NEW CLAIMS, NOT TO A BETTER DETECTOR. A shape that learns to see a
// wording it used to miss finds claims that were already there, and the
// register grows to hold them; "closed" would otherwise mean the detector may
// never improve, which is the opposite of the point. `shapeCensus` is the line
// where that growth is agreed to, one row per shape.
//
// The rows are per shape rather than one total because the number falls two
// ways and only one of them is work. A claim leaves because it was held or
// deleted, or because the detector stopped seeing it — and the second costs
// nothing, changes no code a reader would notice, and reads exactly like the
// first. Priced per shape, looking away has to say which shape stopped looking
// and what it cost.
//
// The register carries no per-entry reasons, and that is deliberate rather than
// sloppy: a reason per entry would be six hundred rationalisations written by
// somebody who has not audited the claim, which is worse than an honest count
// of what is unaudited. The number is the point, it is meant to go down, and it
// is not restated here: a second hand-written copy of a derived total is the
// thing shapeCensus exists to refuse.
