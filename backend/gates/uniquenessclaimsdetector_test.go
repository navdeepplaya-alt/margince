// THE HONEST PART FIRST: this list is hand-written, and it is the one input
// this gate cannot derive. There is no grammar for "a sentence asserting
// uniqueness" the way there is a runtime answer for "which Intl members take a
// locale" — prose is prose. So instead of pretending, the list is held to two
// obligations it CAN meet, both below: every shape must be proven to match a
// real claim taken verbatim from this tree (`claimCorpus`), and every
// near-miss that must NOT match is proven too (the `prose` cases beside it). A shape that
// stops matching anything fails, and a shape widened until it matches ordinary
// prose fails.
//
// What is deliberately OUT, measured rather than guessed: "the one place",
// "the only way", "the one path" and "rather than a second" are ordinary prose
// here far more often than they are claims — 540 hits between them, most of
// them sentences like "the only way to ask the DATABASE" or "one type with one
// branch rather than two authorities". Including them would put ~540 lines of
// noise in a register whose whole value is that its number means something.
// That is a real gap and it is named here rather than left for a reader to
// discover: a claim worded that way is invisible to this gate.
