# End-of-work review orchestration (Stop hook).
#
# Fires when the agent finishes a turn. If — and only if — THIS SESSION edited
# backend Go code, it drives the pre-push review flow:
#
#   1. `craft static` ALWAYS (the deterministic ADR-0045 gate, same diff-scoped
#      contract as .githooks/pre-push). Non-zero exit = BLOCKER finding → the
#      hook blocks the stop and asks the agent to fix, and loops until green.
#      This is cheap and deterministic, so it runs on every changed set.
#   2. The two review subagents run ONCE PER BRANCH, and only on a COMPLETE PR —
#      i.e. once the branch has an open pull request. Mid-work turns get the
#      craft gate and nothing else.
#   3. Anything after that round lets the stop through.
#
# WHY THE ROUND CAP IS KEYED ON THE BRANCH, NOT THE CHANGE: the review set is a
# content hash of the session-edited files, and applying a review finding changes
# those files. Keyed on the hash alone, every fix minted a fresh hash, reset the
# state to `craft`, and requested another pair of subagents — an unbounded loop
# for as long as the reviewers kept finding anything (observed: 12 rounds on one
# PR). The hash still drives the craft gate, so new code is always gated; the
# expensive judgment round is bounded by max_review_rounds per branch.
#
# SESSION-SCOPED (this is the whole point): the review set is the backend Go
# files THIS session touched, derived from the Edit/Write tool calls in the
# session transcript — NOT `git diff origin/main`. A parallel session's
# uncommitted work in the same tree is invisible here, so a read-only or
# frontend-only turn never gets dragged into reviewing code it did not write.
#
# Loop-safe on both axes: the content hash restarts the CRAFT gate on new code
# (that is wanted — new code must be gated), while max_review_rounds keeps the
# subagent pass from restarting with it. A per-set attempt cap prevents trapping
# the session if craft cannot be made green.
#
# Reads the Stop hook JSON on stdin; emits {"decision":"block","reason":...} to
# hold the stop, or exits 0 to allow it. Fails open (allows the stop) whenever
# the transcript is missing or yields no session-edited backend code.
