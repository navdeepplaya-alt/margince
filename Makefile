# Thin delegator: the real Makefile lives in backend/ (the Go module root).
# `make check` is the merge gate; `make dev` boots everything.
# The frontend lane is separate (`make frontend-check`) — it needs node+pnpm,
# which not every backend machine has; CI runs both. Since ADR-0120's composed
# SPA lane the dependency runs BOTH ways: `make check-fe` also needs a Go
# toolchain, because the composed registry the frontend typechecks against is
# produced by gen-composition and nothing else can produce it. A machine that
# runs the full gate needs both toolchains; `make frontend-check` alone is still
# the node-only lane.

# Overridable exactly as in backend/Makefile, so a pinned toolchain reaches the
# one target here that invokes the compiler directly instead of delegating.

# answer whoever asks.

## check-backend — the backend half of the gate: the root deterministic script
## gates plus the backend gate (build, vet, lint, arch-lint, unit + fitness
## tests, contract drift). This is what the CI deterministic-gates job runs.
##
## It still needs no frontend toolchain: contract-frontend-drift is the one leg
## that would, and it skips LOUDLY when pnpm is absent — which is what CI's
## deterministic-gates job does, since it installs Go and nothing else. With pnpm
## present (any `make install` checkout) the leg runs, and that is the case
## #1639 is about: a backend-only author never runs the lane that would
## otherwise catch a stranded frontend schema. On a pull request CI covers the
## same ground from the other side, through fe-quality's fe-drift.
##
## The gates run as a FAN-OUT rather than as a prerequisite list. Every one of
## them is a reader — each either walks the tree and judges what it finds, or
## builds its fixtures under mktemp — so nothing but the list itself ever
## ordered them, and serially they were 191 s of this target (measured, 8-core
## darwin, warm caches). Four alone were 130 s of that, and those four are gone:
## the money-scale and one-spelling censuses are Go and TypeScript tests now,
## walking the tree once inside a lane that was already walking it.
##
## Named in ROOT_SCRIPT_GATES rather than left as prerequisites here, because a
## prerequisite list AND a sub-make over the same names would run each gate
## twice — the fan-out has to be the only place they are asked for.
## Each phase is bracketed by scripts/phase-timer.sh, so a green run ends with a
## table of where its time went. Two things about the bracketing:
##
##   - The brackets are separate recipe lines, not a wrapper around the
##     sub-make. The fan-out line has to STAY a bare `$(MAKE)` line, because
##     backend/gates/frontendlaneparity_test.go reads those lines to find the
##     legs and a wrapper would hide all thirty of them.
##   - The backend gate is NOT bracketed here. It times its own four phases, and
##     a phase around them would be their sum counted twice. PHASE_TIMER_OWNED
##     tells it this target owns the ledger, so it adds its rows to this table
##     instead of resetting and printing one of its own — which is what it does
##     when somebody runs it directly (`make check-go`). This target reads the
##     same variable for the same reason: under `make check` the frontend half
##     still has rows to add, and a report here would print without them.

## check-all — `check` plus the integration lane, which is what a change touching
## backend Go actually has to pass. `check` reaches the integration lane NOT AT
## ALL: its `test` target is `go test ./...`, and every integration file carries
## `//go:build integration`, so the lane's packages compile into nothing and a
## green `check` says nothing about them.
##
## Its own target rather than folding the lane into `check`, because `check` is
## what a docs or frontend change runs and that is most changes: the lane takes
## minutes and needs Postgres up, so paying it on a README edit would train
## everybody to skip the gate that also holds the security cases.
##
## Not in the pre-push hook either, and the reason is this machine rather than
## principle: parallel sessions share one test template, so a hook running the
## lane on every push would have them rebuilding each other's schema mid-run —
## failures that are schema-shaped and look nothing like their cause. The hook
## keeps the checks that are fast, need nothing running, and cannot collide.

## infra-up / infra-down — aliases for the dev stack (some deploy tooling and

## dev — the full local COLD-START stack in a real browser: Postgres + Redis, the api, the
## background worker (cmd/worker — outbox relay + Surface-B runner, always on),
## and the Vite dev server, so the SPA runs against a live api on http://localhost:8080
## (the app on :8080, api behind it on :18080). Starts THIS worktree's stack and
## touches nobody else's: a linked worktree claims its own database, Redis
## logical database, port pair and object bucket, while the primary worktree
## keeps the shared `margince` database on :8080. `DEV_SLUG=<slug>` overrides
## the derived slug for a second stack inside one worktree. A bound port stops
## the boot loudly rather than letting you poll a server from an older branch;
## `make dev-sweep` is the machine-wide clear. Boots COLD: the
## organization + admin the api bootstraps from config/margince.yaml and no
## other data, so onboarding and empty states are the default view — run
## `make seed-dev` on top when you want the demo records. Reads an optional
## Anthropic BYOK key from .env.local for the live cold-start read-back. Logs +
## stop handle under .tmp/dev/<slug>/.
dev:
	@bash scripts/dev.sh up "$(DEV_SLUG)"

## dev-fresh — `make dev` onto a REBUILT database: drops it, re-migrates,
## and boots the installation a first customer gets (organization + admin,
## no records). Use it when the last session left data behind; plain
## `make dev` keeps whatever is there.
##
## Also the cure for a migration-ledger desync: a boot failing with
## `river migrate up: relation "river_migration" already exists` is the shared
## dev database's ledger disagreeing with its schema, not anything the branch
## did. Rebuild it rather than hand-repairing the ledger — the same rule the
## integration lane states for the test database, for the same reason.
dev-fresh:
	@bash scripts/dev.sh up "$(DEV_SLUG)" --fresh

## dev-stop — stop THIS worktree's dev stack and free its ports, the mirror of
## `make dev`. DEV_SLUG=<slug> names another stack in this worktree; DROP=1 also
## drops its per-slug database (never the shared `margince`). To clear every
## stack on the machine, including other worktrees', use `make dev-sweep`.
dev-stop:
	@bash scripts/dev.sh stop "$(DEV_SLUG)" $(if $(filter 1,$(DROP)),--drop,)

## dev-sweep — clear EVERY margince dev stack on this machine: kill every
## api/worker/vite (recorded, orphaned, or belonging to another worktree) and
## forget their claims. `DROP=1` also drops every per-slug margince_dev_*
## database. This is the old bare-`make dev` behaviour, now explicit: `make dev`
## starts your worktree's stack and leaves everyone else's alone.
dev-sweep:
	@bash scripts/dev.sh sweep "" $(if $(filter 1,$(DROP)),--drop,)

## dev-logs — follow the dev stack's log, coloured per process (api/worker/fe)
## and per severity, with the job-queue heartbeat hidden. ROLE=<api|worker|fe|boot>
## narrows to one process, LEVEL=<debug|info|warn|error> sets a severity floor,
## ALL=1 keeps the heartbeat, FOLLOW=0 N=<n> prints the last n lines and exits.
## A dev view only — the servers' own output stays plain text for a collector.

## (var(--gapActions) between two buttons, var(--padCard)/var(--padPanel) inside

## types, so regenerate and commit them together.
##
## It is spelled as the four legs below rather than inline, because CI runs
## those legs as separate jobs in PARALLEL and both callers have to mean the
## same thing. A leg added here reaches CI through the `fe-quality` /
## `fe-unit` / `fe-bundle` aggregates; a leg added only to a CI job would run
## in no local gate at all.

	$(MAKE) fe-drift
	$(MAKE) fe-file-length
	$(MAKE) fe-lint
	$(MAKE) fe-unit
	$(MAKE) fe-build

## fe-ds-gates — the frontend's cheap grep gates on their own, so the CI job that
## wants only them does not also pull a vitest run behind them. Most are
## design-system rules; check-contract-fetch.sh is a contract-transport one, and
## it lives here because what makes a gate belong is being a grep over both
## frontend trees, not which rule it holds.
##
## This recipe is also the list check-ext-frontend-walk.test.sh reads: it holds
## that every gate here reads extensions/*/frontend and not frontend/src alone,
## because a gate scanning a smaller tree than it claims reports PASS and
## nothing notices. A gate added below is measured by that test or named in it.
fe-ds-gates:
	frontend/scripts/check-ds-purity.sh
	frontend/scripts/check-font-lock.sh
	frontend/scripts/check-icon-glyph.sh

	bash frontend/scripts/check-contract-fetch.test.sh
	bash frontend/scripts/check-ext-frontend-walk.test.sh

## fe-drift — the TS type-drift gate on its own: regenerate from the contract
## and fail if the committed types moved.
##
## One spelling, shared with check-backend's contract-frontend-drift leg: the
## artifact list and the "did the generator actually rewrite it" census live in
## the script, so the two lanes cannot come to disagree about what a contract
## change owes. The script skips only when pnpm is absent, which cannot happen
## on this lane — check-fe fails first if the frontend deps are missing.
fe-drift:
	cd frontend && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
	@./scripts/check-contract-frontend-drift.sh

## fe-unit — the vitest suite. FE_COVERAGE=1 instruments the run so it also
## writes frontend/coverage/lcov.info for the `sonarcloud` job — ONE execution
## producing both the verdict and the report, because running the suite a second
## time to collect coverage doubles the lane for a file the first run could have
## written. Off by default: nobody reads an lcov file locally and instrumenting
## for one costs about a third of the run, so a developer does not pay it.
##
## The provider and the reporter live in frontend/vite.config.ts rather than on
## this command line, because the reporter carries an option (`projectRoot`) and
## a CLI `--coverage.reporter` REPLACES the configured entry, option and all.
## check-lcov-paths.sh is the report's acceptance test: an lcov naming files the
## scanner cannot resolve is indistinguishable, everywhere downstream, from a
## suite that covers nothing. Its own test runs on EVERY invocation of this
## target rather than beside it, because the gate itself only runs on the
## FE_COVERAGE runs — which are CI's — while an edit to it lands on a bare
## `make fe-unit`.
FE_COVERAGE ?=
fe-unit:
	bash frontend/scripts/check-lcov-paths.test.sh
	cd frontend && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm exec vitest run \
		$(if $(FE_COVERAGE),--coverage.enabled)
	$(if $(FE_COVERAGE),frontend/scripts/check-lcov-paths.sh frontend/coverage/lcov.info)

## fe-clock-drift — the same vitest suite, run as if it were FE_CLOCK_SKEW_DAYS
## from now, and required to reach the same verdict. A test whose result depends
## on the calendar fails here whatever shape its fixture takes.
##
## Not part of `frontend-check` and not a pull-request gate: what breaks these
## tests is time passing rather than a diff, so it runs daily on `main` from
## scheduled.yml. docs/reference/make-targets.md carries the rest of the why.
##
## The skew is 200 days: past every quarter boundary, renewal window and expiry
## this product's fixtures carry, and short of the ten-year dates a fixture uses
## to mean "effectively never". An unparsable value FAILS rather than shifting
## nothing, and the setup asserts the shift took.
FE_CLOCK_SKEW_DAYS ?= 200
fe-clock-drift:
	cd frontend && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && \
		FE_CLOCK_SKEW_DAYS=$(FE_CLOCK_SKEW_DAYS) pnpm exec vitest run

## fe-quality — every leg of the frontend gate EXCEPT the unit suite and the
## bundle, which CI runs beside this one. Needs Go: the composed lane composes.
fe-quality: fe-typecheck-composed
	$(MAKE) fe-ds-gates
	$(MAKE) fe-drift
	$(MAKE) fe-file-length
	$(MAKE) fe-lint
	$(MAKE) fe-test-ext

## fe-bundle — the production bundle plus the Storybook catalog, the two legs
## that only compile. Storybook is CI-only (it is not in `frontend-check`): a
## story that fails to compile or register must not reach main, but it is not
## something a developer needs to rebuild on every local gate run.
fe-bundle:
	$(MAKE) fe-build
	$(MAKE) fe-storybook

## fe-storybook — build the Storybook catalog (stories must compile + register).
fe-storybook:
	cd frontend && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build-storybook

## fe-install — install the frontend deps (pnpm, frozen lockfile). The FE half
## of `make install`; also what `fe-uat` / `dev` assume has run.
fe-install:
	cd frontend && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

## fe-typecheck — TypeScript typecheck of the frontend (tsc project build, no
## app build). A scope-aware per-task gate for FE-only work.
fe-typecheck:
	cd frontend && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm exec tsc -b

## fe-typecheck-composed — the COMPOSED frontend lane (ADR-0120): typecheck the
## same sources against the generated registry under build/composition/frontend/
## instead of the committed empty-tree stub. The TypeScript mirror of building
## the backend under GOWORK=build/composition/go.work — one program, two
## registries, both proven to compile.
##
## It composes FIRST rather than assuming a composition is on disk, and then
## refuses to run if the generated file is still absent. A lane that skipped
## the generation step and fell back to the vanilla alias would typecheck a
## registry nobody composed and report it as the composed one — the same
## "gate that quietly checks nothing" the CI workflow's own comments warn
## about. Part of `make check-fe`, so the merge gate covers both lanes.

## rewrite the published record from a runner's numbers.

## test-craft-pin — prove the pinned craftsmanship gate is actually pinned: four

## binary still matching its digest. A resolver that quietly fell back to PATH
## would turn every craft lane green against an unknown rubric, and nothing
## downstream could tell.
##
## A prerequisite of craft-static rather than a member of ROOT_SCRIPT_GATES, so
## it runs wherever the gate runs and nowhere it does not: enrolling it in the
## root gates would put a network fetch inside `make check-backend`, whose CI job
## has no other reason to reach the network and should not start failing on a
## download flake.
test-craft-pin:
	@./scripts/test-craft-pin.sh

## craft-static — the deterministic code-craftsmanship gate (ADR-0045) over
## every hand-written Go tree, strict: BLOCKER and MAJOR findings both fail it.
## The pre-push hook (.githooks/pre-push) runs the same bar diff-scoped; this
## target is the full manual sweep, and it is green — the backlog was cleared
## to arm it. extensions/ and fixtures/ are their own Go modules, so `./...`
## never reaches them and the bar has to name them: a first-party unit ships
## the same product, and the fixture is the worked example a unit author copies.
##
## The gate is a pinned binary (scripts/craft-pin.sh), not source in this tree.
## Roots are written from the REPOSITORY ROOT, which is where the binary runs —
## they used to lead with ../../ because the gate was built and run from its own
## directory, which changed the working directory first. A leftover ../../
## resolves outside the repository and reports a clean sweep of nothing, which

## test-desktop-launcher — the launcher's own suite. It exists because a test
## lane that cannot reach a module is a test lane that proves nothing about it,
## and this module hid that longer than any other: desktop/launcher is its own
## module and deliberately OUTSIDE go.work,
## since it supervises the shipped binaries as child processes rather than
## importing them. So `./...` inside backend cannot reach it, the workspace
## cannot reach it, and the seven test files it already carried ran nowhere —
## which is indistinguishable from carrying none. The program every desktop user
## meets first was the one package with no lane.
##
## GOWORK=off for the reason its go.mod states: inside a workspace that does not
## list the module, every package fails to resolve.
##
## LAUNCHER_COVER_OUT (optional): also write a coverage profile there. It exists
## because the product profile CANNOT contain a launcher line — that one is
## `go test -coverpkg=./...` over the backend module, and this module is not in
## it — so the number reported for shipped code a user runs was 0% whatever the
## suite did. A profile of its own is what makes the figure real.

## craft-residue — fail if any unresolved CRAFT-FIX/CRAFT-DISPUTE marker was

craft-residue:

## craft-prose — the rulebook's ## Craftsmanship section agrees with the standard
## the gate applies: every T- or P-id the prose names is a real rule, and the
## range it advertises reaches the highest rule there is.
##
## Both directions, because they fail differently. Prose naming a rule that does
## not exist is survivable — a reader looks for it and finds nothing. A range
## that falls SHORT is not: the reader is told the standard is smaller than it
## is, has no reason to look further, and nothing else in the tree corrects them.
## The prose once advertised "T1-P3" over a rubric of T1-T10 plus P1-P5.
##
## The check lives in the gate rather than here because both directions need its
## section scanner, which survives a fenced example and a fence opener behind a
## list marker. A second copy of that scanner in this tree would be the untested
## one. check-craft-doc stays beside this as the cheap floor: the section exists.
craft-prose:
	@"$$(./scripts/craft-pin.sh)" prose --rulebook AGENTS.md

## check-craft-doc — assert AGENTS.md still carries the `## Craftsmanship`

## secret-scan — no hardcoded credential reaches main: gitleaks over a clean
## `git archive HEAD` export, policy in .gitleaks.toml. Scans the COMMITTED
## tree, not the working tree, so a sibling worktree or a local .env.local
## cannot change the verdict (gitleaks does not honour .gitignore).
## Needs nothing installed: scripts/gitleaks-pin.sh fetches and checksum-verifies
## the one pinned binary, so CI's secret-scan job and a laptop run the same
## scanner and therefore reach the same verdict.
secret-scan:
	@./scripts/secret-scan.sh

## test-secret-scan — prove the secret gate still catches. The plants are
## DERIVED from .gitleaks.toml: every allowlist owes one token of each rule it
## targets, in a file its own paths cover, plus one of a rule it does not — so
## it proves the exemption covers the line it names rather than the file, and
## an allowlist added tomorrow is gated without anyone remembering to add a
## case. An over-broad allowlist reports "no leaks found" exactly like a clean
## tree, so the policy is only trustworthy with this beside it.
test-secret-scan:

## test-sbom-sign — prove `sbom-sign` signs what is unsigned and skips what
## already carries a current bundle. A Rekor entry is permanent, so a second one
## for the same bytes leaves the first corroborating nothing — and a run that
## signs everything again looks exactly like a clean one. cosign is stubbed:
## what is under test is which files reach it.
test-sbom-sign:

## test-api-entrypoint — prove the container entrypoint writes the bootstrap
## credential ONLY onto an unprovisioned installation, retires a spent one, and
## refuses to start when it cannot tell which it is. Every failure on that path
## is silent in a container nobody watches, so the behaviour needs a test rather
## than a reading.
test-api-entrypoint:
	@./scripts/test-api-entrypoint.sh
## test-dev-dsn — prove the dev stack resolves its DSNs through the same names
## the binaries read (MARGINCE_OWNER_DSN / MARGINCE_DSN), still owns the
## database name itself so a DEV_SLUG stack cannot land on the base database,
## keeps a query string like ?sslmode=require, and never echoes a DSN.
test-dev-dsn:
	@./scripts/test-dev-dsn.sh

## test-testdb-redis — prove `make test-it` and scripts/test-integration-one.sh
## settle on ONE Redis address, and that REDIS_PORT reaches both.
##
## The failure it replaces: the script route left MARGINCE_TEST_REDIS unset, so
## every Redis-using test in the package failed naming Redis and telling the
## reader to run `make db-up` — on a machine where Redis was already up.
test-testdb-redis:
	@./scripts/test-testdb-redis.sh

## test-lane-timeout-report — prove a package killed for exceeding its budget is
## reported as a TIMEOUT rather than as hundreds of "assigned but not run" lines,
## and that it does not bury a divergence it did not cause.
test-lane-timeout-report:
	@./scripts/test-lane-timeout-report.sh

## test-dev-isolation — prove two worktrees get two stacks: the slug comes from
## the worktree, the Redis database and the port pair are CLAIMED from one
## machine-global registry rather than hashed, and the object bucket is
## per-stack. The failure it replaces was silent — two stacks sharing one Redis
## consumer group, each acking events the other never saw.
test-dev-isolation:
	@./scripts/test-dev-isolation.sh

## test-dev-cleanup — prove a failed `make dev` leaves nothing running: the EXIT
## trap is armed for every `up` rather than only for a stack that claims a port,
## it follows TERM with KILL, and it spares a stack that was already up. The
## failure it replaces was an api or a Vite outliving the run on the PRIMARY
## stack, which the next `make dev` reported as a port already in use.
test-dev-cleanup:
	@./scripts/test-dev-cleanup.sh

## test-scheduled-report — prove the scheduled lane still files ONE issue per
## failing check: stub the tracker, and require the reporter to find an already
## open issue however far down the list it sits. A dedupe that misses reads
## exactly like a first report, so the reporter is only trustworthy with this
## beside it. Gated here rather than in the scheduled lane itself, because that
## lane runs the reporter only on a red day — an edit to it lands on a green one.
test-scheduled-report:
	@./scripts/test-scheduled-report.sh

## test-ci-verdict — prove the single required check still refuses to read a
## skipped job as a passing one on the merge queue. GitHub counts a skipped
## required check as passing, so that rule is the only reason nine required
## contexts could safely collapse into one; a regression in it would show up as
## a green `ci` over a lane that ran nothing, which is indistinguishable from
## the real thing on every dashboard.
test-ci-verdict:
	@./scripts/test-ci-verdict.sh

## test-merge-verdict — prove the push-time alarm still tells an ABSENT verdict
## from a green one. The alarm is silent when it is working, so "it did not go
## off" is precisely the signal that was already untrustworthy; and the case it
## exists for is a required check that never reported, which anything asking
## "was it green?" reads the same as a pass.
test-merge-verdict:
	@./scripts/test-check-merge-verdict.sh

## test-review-coverage — prove the review-coverage report still tells a review
## of the tip from a review of something older. It is quiet when it is working,
## so "no complaint" is the signal that cannot be trusted on its own; and the
## arm with no natural symptom is a force-push, where the approval goes on
## standing against a tree nobody compared it to.
test-review-coverage:
	@./scripts/test-check-review-coverage.sh

## test-laneorder — prove the integration lane still dispatches its long pole
## first. The order is only a scheduling hint, so a regression here never turns
## a lane red: it makes the run longer and says nothing, which is why it needs a
## test of its own rather than the lane's own verdict. Also pins the committed
## baseline a fresh clone orders by, which has no measurements to fall back on.
test-laneorder:
	@./scripts/test-laneorder.sh

## check-image-pins — every `uses:` in .github/workflows/ AND every container
## `image:` (workflow service containers + docker-compose.dev.yml) is
## pinned to an immutable ref (supply-chain: a floating vN/main tag or image
## tag lets a compromised artifact ride into CI unreviewed). Lives at the root
## because the workflows do; also a CI step, so a pin can't regress.
check-image-pins:
	@./scripts/check-image-pins.sh

## check-host-ports — every host port published by docker-compose.dev.yml
## sits BELOW the ephemeral floor (32768). A published port inside the kernel's
## ephemeral range can be transiently held as some unrelated process's client
## port, and `make db-up` then loses the bind and fails the job it was setting
## up for — a race that reads as a flake in whatever step called it. Enforced
## rather than commented because the constraint is invisible in the number.

## with that absolute scan-root prefix while SPDX names are repo-relative, and the

## one empty-name scan-root entry that CycloneDX omits. Strip the prefix and drop the
## pseudo-entries so all three enumerate the same repo-relative regular files. Done on
## the syft output before any signature, so the signed bytes are the normalized bytes.
## Both filters are idempotent, so re-running (or a future syft that already emits
## relative names / no directories) is a no-op. The zero SHA1 is syft's directory
## placeholder; a real file always carries a non-zero SHA-256/512 alongside it. That
## placeholder is the only signal syft gives — v1.50 labels every SPDX element,
## directories included, software_fileKind == "file", so the kind field cannot single
## a directory out; the empty name / lone zero SHA1 pair is what distinguishes them.

## sbom-validate — conformance gate: each SBOM must validate against its own format,
## so a syft bump, a config change, or a normalization filter that emitted a malformed
## document fails here rather than being signed and shipped. sbom-parity proves the
## three agree with each other; this proves each is a valid document of its format.
## CycloneDX goes through the first-party cyclonedx-cli (bundles the spec schema);
## --fail-on-errors is load-bearing — without it the CLI prints "BOM is not valid" but
## still exits 0. SPDX 2.2.1 goes through pyspdxtools, which validates structure AND SPDX
## semantics (e.g. dataLicense must be CC0-1.0, at least one creator) and exits non-zero
## on an invalid document, so the recipe gates on its exit status and prints its report
## for context on failure. SPDX 3.0 has no usable semantic validator yet
## ($(SBOM_SCHEMA_DIR)/README.md records the finding) and validates structurally against
## the pinned schema. `make sbom` runs this after parity; CI runs `make sbom`, so every
## SBOM CI run is gated, and sbom-sign re-runs it so only valid bytes are signed.

## sbom-sign — keyless-sign each generated SBOM with cosign (writes *.cosign.bundle; needs an OIDC token).
## Depends on parity + validate, not sbom: the signature must cover normalized,
## mutually agreeing, schema-valid bytes, but re-running generation here is wrong — in
## CI signing is a separate job (holding id-token: write) that consumes the generation
## job's artifact, and running the syft scan under that token is the isolation the SBOM
## workflow forbids. Both gates re-check the existing files cheaply and refuse to sign a
## stale, un-normalized, or malformed set.
##
## Signing is SKIPPED for a file that already carries a bundle at least as new as
## itself, and that is the recovery path rather than a micro-optimisation. A
## Rekor entry is permanent and cannot be retracted, so a re-run that signs
## again does not replace the first entry — it adds a second, and leaves the
## first as a claim in a public append-only log that no published artifact
## corroborates. The window is real: the entry is written before the bundle
## reaches disk and the bundle is published after that, so a job cancelled in
## between (a maintainer's hand, the runner's own ceiling) lands exactly there.
## Re-running the same workspace now converges instead of accumulating.
##
## The comparison is the SBOM's mtime against its bundle's, not the bundle's
## mere existence: a regenerated SBOM under an older bundle is a signature over
## bytes that are gone, and skipping there would publish a bundle that verifies
## against nothing.
##
## The prerequisites are a variable so scripts/test-sbom-sign.sh can drive the
## skip decision without standing up three pinned validator containers. It is
## the only override, and overriding it does not weaken CI: the workflow runs
## the bare target.

## sbom-gate — the license gate as CI runs it: scan, judge, and retry the PAIR.
##
## `.syft.yaml` sets `enrich: all`, so a scan asks the Go module proxy and the
## npm registry for licences. A lookup that FAILS resolves the package to no
## licence, and grant cannot tell "we could not ask" from "it has a forbidden
## one" — so it denies. Three concurrent scans hitting the registry together are
## enough, and the giveaway is that the denied set MOVES between runs of one
## commit: a missing licence does not wander.
##
## The retry wraps the pair rather than living inside `make sbom`, and that is
## the whole design. A retry keyed on "packages that resolved to no licence"
## would have to know which of those are legitimate — our own Go modules, and
## everything `sbom-supplement` fills in afterwards — which is `.grant.yaml`'s
## rules spelled a second time. The GATE is already the oracle for that, so
## asking it again duplicates nothing.
##
## The posture is unchanged. A package whose licence is genuinely absent
## resolves to nothing on every attempt and is denied on the last one, with
## grant's own output as the verdict. Retrying can only turn a network failure
## into the answer the network would have given.
