# Make targets

The real Makefile is `backend/Makefile`; the root Makefile delegates the
backend targets and adds the frontend lane. In `backend/`, `make` (or `make
help`) lists targets with descriptions. Every target that listing advertises
also runs as `make <name>` from the repo root, which `make-target-parity`
enforces — so a command copied out of here works from either directory.

## Everyday

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `help` | List targets (the default goal) |
| `install` | One-shot fresh-worktree setup (frontend deps + Go gate binaries + git hooks). The factory's `worktree-init` runs this by name |
| `dev` | Full local stack: db-up + migrate + `cmd/api` + `cmd/worker` (always on: the outbox relay + Surface-B runner) + the app on `http://localhost:8080` (the api behind it on `:18080`, proxied through). Starts **this worktree's** stack only and touches no other (`make dev-sweep` is the machine-wide clear). A linked worktree claims its own database, Redis logical database, port pair and object bucket automatically; the primary worktree keeps the shared `margince` on `:8080`. Boots **cold** — the organization + admin bootstrapped from `config/margince.yaml` and nothing else, so onboarding and empty states are the default; `make seed-dev` adds the demo records on top. Returns when ready; the servers run in the background. On a slug whose stack is ALREADY running it restarts: the processes it finds under that slug are stopped first — named on the way past — and it then boots fresh, so re-running `make dev` after a backend change stays the reflex it reads as. Without that the new run booted beside the old one and the survivors became nameless: `make dev-stop` stopped the new stack while the old worker went on draining the queue against a database the next run was about to migrate. `DEV_SLUG=<slug>` overrides the derived slug when you want a second stack inside one worktree. Activates a real model for the cold-start read-back only when every cloud provider bound by `seeds.ai_routing` (in `config/margince.dev.yaml`, or your own `config/margince.yaml`) has its BYOK key in the environment / `.env.local` — otherwise the offline fake. The binding itself is a stored setting, planted at bootstrap; the api and worker read no routing file |
| `dev-fresh` | `make dev-fresh [DEV_SLUG=<slug>]` — `dev` onto a **rebuilt** database: drops it, re-migrates, and boots the installation a first customer gets. Plain `dev` keeps whatever data is there, so a restart for a backend change never costs you a half-finished record. It is also the cure for a migration-ledger desync — a boot failing with `river migrate up: relation "river_migration" already exists` is the shared dev database's ledger disagreeing with its schema, not anything the branch did. Rebuild it; do not hand-repair the ledger, for the reason the integration lane gives |
| `dev-stop` | `make dev-stop [DEV_SLUG=<slug>] [DROP=1]` — stops **this worktree's** stack and frees its ports. `DROP=1` also drops its per-slug `margince_dev_*` database — never the shared `margince` |
| `dev-sweep` | `make dev-sweep [DROP=1]` — clears **every** margince dev stack on the machine: every api/worker/vite, recorded, orphaned, or from another worktree, and their claims. `DROP=1` also drops every per-slug `margince_dev_*` database. This is the old bare-`make dev` behaviour, now explicit |
| `dev-logs` | `make dev-logs [DEV_SLUG=<slug>] [ROLE=api\|worker\|fe\|boot] [LEVEL=debug\|info\|warn\|error] [ALL=1] [FOLLOW=0 N=<n>]` — follow this worktree's `dev.log` (under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/margince/dev/<slug>/`, or `_base/` for the primary worktree) coloured by process and severity. api, worker and Vite all append to that one file, so `make dev` tags each line with the process that wrote it. At `MARGINCE_LOG_LEVEL=debug` the writer also colours the tag and severity **in the file**, so a plain `tail -f` is readable on its own; at info level the file stays plain text so `grep` and editors see clean lines. This view strips whatever colour is there and repaints, so its filters work either way. The job-queue (River) heartbeat is hidden by default because at `MARGINCE_LOG_LEVEL=debug` it repeats every few seconds and pushes real lines off the screen; `ALL=1` restores it. `LEVEL` is a floor, so `LEVEL=warn` shows warnings **and** errors. A dev view only: the servers' own output is unchanged plain text for a log collector |
| `db-up` / `infra-up` | Start the dev Postgres 16 (pgvector, port 15432) and Redis 7 (port 16379) containers, create the app role (`infra-up` is an alias) |
| `db-init` | (Re)apply `scripts/db-init.sql` to the running Postgres |
| `migrate` | Apply core + custom migrations with the owner DSN |
| `infra-down` | Stop the dev containers but keep the data volumes |
| `clean` | Remove the dev containers **and** the data volumes |

## Factory-compatibility golden commands

These are the target names the dark-factory tooling, its UAT runner, and its
UAT guides call by name (`docs/target-minimum-setup.md §3`). `check-q`,
`check-go`, and `fe-typecheck` are the quiet/scope-aware gate variants;
`test-integration` ends with the literal `OK: integration passed with 0 skips`.

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check-q` | Quiet `make check` — full log in `.tmp/check.log`, excerpt on failure |
| `check-go` | The Go half of the gate (`make -C backend check`) |
| `fe-install` / `fe-typecheck` | Frontend deps install / `tsc` typecheck (scope-aware FE gates) |

## Gates

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check` | **The merge gate.** Backend `make check` = build + vet + lint + arch-lint + test + drift. Root `make check` runs that **plus** the craft-doc floor, image pins, contract breaking-change (`oasdiff`), test-lane hygiene, and the file-length ratchet |
| `check-all` | **What a change touching backend Go has to pass**: `check` plus the integration lane. `check` reaches that lane **not at all** — its `test` target is `go test ./...`, and every integration file carries `//go:build integration`, so those packages compile into nothing and a green `check` says nothing about them. Needs `make db-up`, and takes minutes: `check` stays the target for docs and frontend work, which is most changes. Deliberately not in the pre-push hook — parallel sessions on one machine share the test template, so a hook running the lane on every push would have them rebuilding each other's schema mid-run |
| `check-backend` / `check-fe` | The two halves of the root gate, runnable alone: `check-backend` = backend `check` + the root script gates below (what CI's deterministic-gates job runs; it needs no frontend toolchain — `contract-frontend-drift` skips loudly without pnpm); `check-fe` = the composed typecheck, `frontend-check`, and the unit screens' own suites (`fe-test-ext`), with a loud fail if `frontend/node_modules` is missing |
| `build` | `go build ./...` |
| `vet` | `go vet ./...` |
| `test` | Unit tests; the fitness gates in `backend/gates/` (license header, write shape, architecture, enum sync, `audit_log` enum coherence, contract `$ref` resolution) run uncached |
| `test-integration` | Real-Postgres lane (`-tags integration`): cross-tenant isolation gates, governed-agent loop, HTTP end-to-end. Runs on its own `margince_test` namespace, never the dev `margince` DB, so it can run concurrently with `make dev`. **Parallel** — each package runs on its own throwaway clone db (`CREATE DATABASE … TEMPLATE margince_test`) + private MinIO bucket + its own Redis logical db (1..15 by slot; db 0 stays reserved for `make dev`), so packages share nothing; within a package still `-p 1`. Fails loudly without a database — never skips. Tune concurrency with `INTEGRATION_JOBS=N`. CI additionally slices the lane per test across six runners: `INTEGRATION_SHARD=k/N` runs the k-th deterministic slice (debug a red CI shard locally with exactly that), `INTEGRATION_SHARD_OUT=dir` collects the manifests + coverage pods `scripts/test-integration-reconcile.sh` verifies and merges |
| `test-db-up` | (Re)build the migrated `margince_test` template the parallel lane clones from |
| `test-it` | Run ONE integration package on a throwaway clone (+ own MinIO bucket + Redis db 15): `make test-it DIR=backend/internal/modules/people [RUN=TestName]` |
| `e2e-siteread` | (backend Makefile) Deep-read quality floor vs the real gradion.com (`-tags e2e_llm`): paid, network, opt-in. Judge a candidate model with `MARGINCE_E2E_MODEL=provider:model` (+ its BYOK key); every assertion is a floor — a different model must extract the same or better to pass |
| `e2e-ai` | Certify AI tasks against the corpus (`-tags e2e_llm`, `TestE2ECertify`): paid, network, opt-in. Names what it certifies outright, one of two ways: `MODEL=<provider:model>` binds ONE candidate to every task, and `ROUTING=<config>` certifies a DEPLOYMENT — each task measured against the model the config's `seeds.ai_routing` binds at that task's **leading ladder rung**, the one that would actually serve it, so one run writes records across several models. The two are mutually exclusive and the run refuses both. `JUDGE=<provider:model>` is always required, is never resolved from the routing, and is refused if equal to a candidate, because one grading itself is certified by construction. `BASE_URL=` carries a broker host (`openai_compatible` fails closed without one) and `PROFILE=` the environment class a record is filed under (ignored under `ROUTING=`, which takes the profile from the config that named the models). Narrow with `TASK=<task>`, repeat with `RUNS=<n>`. Dumps every candidate+judge request/response (the `ai_call_payload` shape, post-stripper) to a gitignored `.tmp/aicert/*.jsonl` and prints the path — on by default (`TRACE=<dir>` to relocate, `TRACE=` to disable). Survives a dropped connection two ways: a run the router failed every bound tier on is re-driven (3 attempts, 2s then 8s, never for an exhausted account or a failed validator), and every scored run is journaled to `.tmp/aicert/resume/` so a restart replays it instead of paying again — same bindings, profile, corpus, scenario stamp and binary, within six hours, one run per directory; on by default (`RESUME=<dir>` to relocate, `RESUME=` to measure everything fresh). Fails loudly — never skips — without a binding or a corpus match |
| `e2e-ai-report` | Print the certification readiness report: one row per shipped invocation site (from the census, so a MISSING record is visible), its band, that site's own runs/passed and the accepted/wrong_answer/invalid/abstained counts behind them, the scope certified (`full_invocation`, `single_turn` or `single_call`), and the (provider, model, env) it was measured on. Four states, never collapsed and never rendered as a row of zeroes: a record every one of whose scenario stamps still matches what this build sends renders `current`; one that is still right about every case it measured while the corpus has grown cases it never saw renders `partial`, with `SCENARIOS` giving how many of the site's current scenarios it still describes over how many that site ships today; one whose measured scenario — or the prompt its own code builds from it — has changed since renders `stale`; one that was never produced renders `absent`. A record written before per-scenario stamps existed is judged by its task stamp alone and shows `-` for coverage. Reads `backend/internal/compose/aicert/{corpus,records}/`. `go run`-only dev tool (`internal/compose/aicert/reportcmd`), not a shipped binary and **not a merge gate**: it always exits 0, because the lane it reports on is paid and manual. The same judgement, rendered as a page with a link to every scenario — and as `ai-certification.json` beside it, for a reader analysing the numbers themselves — is [ai-certification.md](ai-certification.md) — regenerated by `cd backend && go test ./internal/compose/aicert/ -run TestAICertificationPage -update-ai-cert`, and unlike this target that one DOES fail when the committed copy has gone stale |
| `e2e-llm` | Drive the six deck use cases with a REAL assistant and check what it said (`e2e/llm/scenarios/*.yaml`, judged by `e2e/llm/check.py`). The half the Go suite in `integration/e2e/usecases/` cannot answer: those pin the payloads, the refusals and the legibility fields, and would stay green while the surface became undrivable. **Paid and opt-in** — refuses without `MARGINCE_E2E_LLM=1`, and needs one of `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (a subscription token from `claude setup-token`), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (a Console API key) or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (a gateway bearer) — the CLI ranks them in the reverse of that order and the run prints which one it took. Not deterministic by construction: each scenario runs three times and passes at two, because one bad run is the weather and two is a defect. Boots, seeds and tears down its own `DEV_SLUG` stack, so it never touches :8080. `SCENARIO=<name>` runs one, `E2E_LLM_KEEP=1` leaves the stack up. Transcripts land in the gitignored `e2e/llm/records/` and are the finding — a verdict line says which scenario failed, only the transcript says what the assistant did. Runs weekly on `main` in `scheduled.yml` |
| `ai-probe` | Probe ONE production AI invocation site against input an operator supplies, through the same certification case `make e2e-ai` drives (`Prepare`/`Run`/`Evaluate`). Answers a different question from `e2e-ai`: that one asks whether a model is good enough for a prompt, this asks whether a site survives THIS input — which is how a site can be certified 1.00 and still fail in the field. Four verbs via `ARGS=`: `list` (every registered site with its kind, certified scope and tier ladder), `scaffold <task>/<variant>` (a starter scenario copied from the corpus), `fetch <url>` (what crosses the fetch boundary — HTML reduced by `StripTags`, markdown and JSON verbatim — reporting media type, bytes and **passage count**; a route may reduce further before building its request, as the model-cost refresh does for a JSON catalog), and `run` (`--scenario` or `--fixture`+`--expect`+`--site`). Free except `run` against a real binding, which makes one model call — no judge, no scoring, no records written. DB-less. Artifacts land in the gitignored `.tmp/aitask/` because a fetched page carries whatever the source carried. BYOK key auto-loaded from `.env.local`. See [debug an AI task](../how-to/debug-an-ai-task.md) |
| `test-integration-serial` | Escape hatch: the old sequential lane on the shared `margince_test` DB (for debugging a parallel-isolation issue) |
| `lint` | `golangci-lint run` (depguard, gosec, misspell, revive, gofmt), through the `scripts/run-golangci.sh` wrapper `lint-modules` also uses — see `test-golangci-guard` for what it stops the shared analysis cache doing |
| `arch-lint` | go-arch-lint over `.go-arch-lint.yml` — a hard gate on the import DAG |
| `gen` | Regenerate everything derived from `api/crm.yaml` (contract types, 501 stubs, agent-policy table) and the extension composition |
| `drift` | `gen`, then fail if any generated file changed — the contract drift gate |
| `composition` | Materialize `build/composition/` from the enabled set under `extensions/`. Every build/test lane depends on it and runs under `GOWORK=build/composition/go.work`, so an enabled extension is compiled in and a stale composition is never built. A default checkout composes `{de}` (the first-party pack ships enabled); removing every directory under `extensions/` composes the empty set, whose wiring is byte-identical to the committed `composition/` stub |
| `check-composition` | `composition`, then `gen-composition -verify`: a clean regeneration must reproduce `composition.json`'s recorded input digests and output hashes byte-for-byte (the drift gate for ignored composition output) |
| `test-extensions` | Every enabled extension's own test lane (each unit under `extensions/` is its own Go module — `./...` never reaches them), run on the composed workspace; part of `make check` |
| `gen-workflow` | `make gen-workflow NAME=<snake_case_handler_name>` — scaffold a new automation `workflow.Handler` + its test stub (write-once; refuses to overwrite an existing scaffold). See [how-to/create-a-workflow.md](../how-to/create-a-workflow.md) |

The root `make check` runs the backend gate above **and** these deterministic
root script gates (each is a small script; all merge-blocking, and `check-backend` fans them out):

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check-image-pins` | Every workflow `uses:` and container `image:` is pinned to an immutable ref |
| `check-host-ports` | Every host port published by `docker-compose.dev.yml` is below the ephemeral floor (32768), so `db-up` cannot lose a bind to a transient client port |
| `make-target-parity` | Every backend target `make help` advertises resolves from the repo root, as the help text promises. The root delegation list is hand-maintained, so a new backend target can be advertised and unreachable at once — and a CI step that calls it then fails at `No rule to make target` without ever running what it was gating |
| `contract-breaking-check` | oasdiff severity gate on `api/crm.yaml` vs `origin/main` (breaking change fails; additive passes) |
| `contract-frontend-drift` | The **third** regeneration a `backend/api/crm.yaml` change owes: `pnpm gen:api` writes `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` + `public-events.ts`, and until #1639 only the frontend lane enforced it — so a backend-only author could go green through the whole backend gate and strand the frontend types (#1573). Skips **loudly** when `pnpm` is absent (CI's `deterministic-gates` job installs Go only, and takes that path). The pull-request path is covered instead by `fe-quality`'s `fe-drift`, whose routing `TestTheContractReachesTheFrontendLane` pins. `fe-drift` runs this same script, so both lanes have one spelling. A `check-backend` prerequisite |
| `test-contract-frontend-drift` | `contract-frontend-drift`'s own test: the skip is loud, goes to stderr, is the gate's only early exit, and the artifact census precedes it. A gate that may skip is a gate that can skip silently, which is the defect it was written for. A `check-backend` prerequisite |
| `migration-versions` | Every migration version this branch adds is unclaimed on `origin/main` and sorts above the highest one there — per namespace, derived from `backend/migrations/*/`. Two PRs numbering against the same `main` each pass the per-tree loader test and collide only in the merge, which is how core `0240` (and `0248` the next day) ended up claimed twice and left `main` unable to load its own sequence. A version *below* the base's highest fails too, and is the worse case: the runner skips only what its ledger already names, so the migration still applies — but before the base's highest on a fresh database and after it on one already past that point, which leaves two schemas wherever the order matters. Overrides: `MIGRATION_VERSIONS_REQUIRE_BASE=1` (CI; a missing base ref is a broken checkout, not a skip), and a base ref as `$1`. A baseline consolidation is the one legitimate exception and must DECLARE itself with `MIGRATION_VERSIONS_BASELINE_RESET=1`; the declaration is honored only where the namespace both collapses (fewer migrations than the base) and shares no `(version, name)` pair with it, so it goes inert on its own once the consolidation merges (self-tested by `test-migration-versions`). |
| `test-lanes` | Hermetic-unit-lane check: no untagged test opens a real Postgres/Redis |
| `env-reads` | OPS-CFG-2: nothing under `backend/internal` reads the environment — config is resolved once at the composition root and injected. Ratcheted via `scripts/env-read-waivers.txt` (pre-existing offenders may shrink, never grow; #1252 burns them down). `cmd/**`, `*_test.go`, `//go:build integration` harnesses and `platform/cliflags` are exempt |
| `gofmt` | Every tracked hand-written Go file is gofmt-clean, in **every** module. Not redundant with `lint-modules`, which enforces the same rule through golangci: golangci needs a type-checkable package and the `fixtures/` units deliberately are not one, while gofmt only has to parse. So this is the one formatting check with no exceptions, and the cheap floor that holds when a module is temporarily unlintable. The file list comes from `git ls-files`, so a new module is covered the day it is committed; generated `*_gen.go`/`*.gen.go` are exempt (their generator owns their bytes) |
| `lint-modules` | golangci-lint over the Go modules the backend lint lane cannot reach. `make -C backend lint` runs `./...` from `backend/`, which stops at the module boundary — `backend/tools`, `cli/craft`, `composition` and each unit under `extensions/` are separate modules and were linted by nothing. Same `backend/.golangci.yml` as the product module (one bar, no second copy to drift); the module list derives from tracked `go.mod` files, so a new module is covered the day it is committed. Runs **uncapped** (`--max-same-issues=0`): golangci's default of 3 hides repeats, and a truncating gate reads like a passing one. Two exclusions, both reasoned in the script — `backend` (already linted twice by its own lane) and `fixtures/` (imports the product module while declaring no require, so it type-checks only inside the harness that composes it; still covered by craft, the license test and `gofmt`) |
| `test-golangci-guard` | Prove `scripts/run-golangci.sh` still tells a finding in this checkout from one golangci's cache remembers from another. Its analysis cache is machine-wide, shared by every worktree, and keyed by file **content**, so an unchanged file has one entry across all of them — carrying the path of whichever worktree filled it. A run that gets that entry can read neither the `//nolint:` directives in the file nor the path-anchored exclusions in `.golangci.yml`, so waived findings come back against a foreign path, under module names that do exist here (issue #1378). The wrapper both lint lanes run through resolves every reported path and quarantines the run (exit 40) instead; this asserts both directions, since a guard that flagged every run — `cli/craft` legitimately reports as `../cli/craft/…` — reads exactly like a working one from the passing side |
| `go-file-length` | Hard 500-LOC cap on hand-written **product** Go, ratcheted via `scripts/go-file-length-waivers.txt`. Test and generated files are exempt here — `*_test.go` is bounded at 1000 lines by the craft gate instead |
| `fe-file-length` | The same cap on `frontend/src` — 500 for product code, 1000 for a test, story, testkit or fixture — ratcheted via `scripts/fe-file-length-waivers.txt`. Generated types and the i18n catalogs are exempt: one is the generator's output, the others are data read by lookup rather than top to bottom |
| — (script) | `scripts/seed-fe-file-length-waivers.sh` re-freezes that list at the tree's current sizes. For ESTABLISHING the baseline, never for absorbing a file that grew — running it on a failing gate would freeze the growth, which is the one thing the ratchet refuses |
| `rls-store-path` | No `internal/modules` statement addresses the superuser pool directly (RLS bypass); `// rls-exempt: <reason>` is the escape for a genuinely cross-workspace query |
| `no-jurisdiction` | No country-specific regulatory identifier (XRechnung/ZUGFeRD/DATEV/…) or ISO-3166 code in core **code**, only in the jurisdiction seam (`internal/modules/de`, `internal/shared/ports/jurisdiction`); statute citations in comments are allowed |
| `test-e2e-llm-check` | Points the e2e-llm checker at hand-written stream-json transcripts and asserts it tells a failed use case apart from a run that never happened: a refused credential (`401`), a transcript with no assistant turn, and an error with no message are each named as a harness fault, while a run that answered badly is still scored as a finding. Also asserts the lane WIRES that check and stops on it, since running the real lane needs a key and a live stack |
| `test-dev-postgres-container` | Points the dev-database resolver at a stubbed `docker ps` and asserts the verdict sentence on each shape: one publisher resolves, none refuses rather than falling back to the compose project, two refuse NAMING both (a developer has to know which stack to stop), and the query filters on the port AND the compose service label |
| `changelog-sections` | **Keep a Changelog**: one `### ` section per change type per release in `CHANGELOG.md`. The change types are read FROM the file, so a release that grows a new one is held the day it appears |
| `test-changelog-sections` | Points that gate at planted files and asserts the verdict sentence on each: a type split in two, a third copy counted as the third, the same type under two releases (not a duplicate), a heading above the first release (out of scope), and both ways of reading nothing (a refusal, since either looks exactly like a clean file) |
| `test-migration-versions` | Points that gate at throwaway git repositories and asserts its verdict on ten planted cases: each of the four defects it names fires (collision, sorts-below, duplicate-in-tree, undeclared consolidation), and every branch of the baseline-reset declaration is exercised — admitted for a real consolidation, refused for a survivor at the base's version AND name, refused for a one-for-one rename that does not collapse, and refused for a real collision. Each case also asserts a string the gate's own output must contain, so a gate broken such that it exits non-zero for an unrelated reason cannot pass for a detection; setup and mutation failures fail the case rather than leaving a clean tree that passes; and the harness unsets the gate's own switch and git's environment, because CI sets the reset declaration on the same step this target runs on |
| `pkg-freeze` | Published-surface freeze (EXT-P3): apidiff on every `backend/pkg` package vs the merge target (`origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF` in CI; locally the extensions integration branch, else `origin/main`). **Advisory before the first v1+ release tag** — incompatible changes print, never block (the surface is design-fluid). **Enforcing from v1.0.0** — incompatible changes and removed packages fail; a ratified change is its exact apidiff finding line in `scripts/pkg-freeze-allowlist.txt`, bound to the merge-base sha it was ratified against (superseded entries license nothing and warn); removals are never allowlistable. Overrides: `PKG_FREEZE_MODE=advisory\|enforce`, `PKG_FREEZE_BASE=<ref>` |

### Where the gate spends its time

Every green `make check` ends with a table of its own phases, so the next person
to optimize it starts from a reading of their machine rather than from a number
in a comment. Both halves report: the backend's four phases and the gate
fan-out, and the frontend's composed typecheck, core suite and unit screens.

The distribution is lopsided, and it is worth knowing which end to pull. On a
quiet laptop the frontend's five core legs measure ds-gates 12s, drift 3s, lint
2s, **unit 75s**, build 3s — so `fe-unit` alone is about 79% of those 95s and
everything else together is 20s. An optimization that does not touch the
vitest suite is arguing over the remainder.

### What has already been tried, and rejected

Each of these looks obviously right and is not. They are recorded because the
measurement is the expensive part, and re-deriving a "no" costs the same as
deriving it the first time.

- **`pool: threads` for vitest.** Reads as a large win under load and is a loss
  on an idle machine: forks 73s vs threads 99s measured quiet, the sign opposite
  to the contended reading that suggested it. It also shares one jsdom across a
  worker's files, which two suites here depend on not happening (#2866). vitest
  4's `forks` default is correct for this tree.
- **Fanning `frontend-check`'s five legs out under `-j`.** Four of them begin
  with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` into one `frontend/node_modules`;
  concurrently they race the `.bin` symlink farm and leave the tree broken
  (`ENOENT ... chmod`, exit 2). That CI runs these five as parallel *jobs* is not
  evidence for it: a CI job has its own checkout, so the isolation the local run
  needs is the one thing CI's green never tested. A working fan-out was worth
  about 20s.
- **Running `check-backend` and `check-fe` concurrently.** The backend's last two
  phases (`drift`, `check-composition`) REWRITE `build/composition/` and
  `*_gen.go` in place, and both frontend legs read `build/composition/`. This is
  the write-under-reader race the backend `check` recipe already keeps its own
  phases serial to avoid — running the halves together reintroduces it across a
  wider surface.

## Occasional

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `vuln` | govulncheck over all packages. Not part of `check` — it answers against a database that changes daily, so it runs per-PR in `ci.yml` and again daily against `main` in `scheduled.yml`, which is the only lane that can find a vulnerability disclosed after a merge |
| `hooks` (root) | Point git at `.githooks/` (`core.hooksPath`), arming the diff-scoped pre-push craft gate and the store-path/jurisdiction script gates. Run once after cloning; `make install` does it for you. The backend's own `make -C backend hooks` is a **different** target that installs `scripts/pre-commit` (gofmt + license header) — it does **not** set `core.hooksPath`, so it alone leaves the strict pre-push gate disarmed |
| `check-gates` | The meta-gate lane: the waiver census, the obligations derived from the migrations and the contract, and the walk-scope proofs. A dev-loop convenience — deliberately **not** a `check-backend` prerequisite, since `make -C backend check` already runs these tests uncached |
| `tools` / `tools-go` | Install every gate binary at its pinned version (fresh-machine bootstrap) |
| `migrate-up` / `migrate-down` | Alias for `migrate` / roll back the last migration(s) (`STEPS=n`) |
| `migrate-create` | `make migrate-create NAME=add_renewal_risk` — scaffold a core `.up.sql`/`.down.sql` pair named for the current unix second. The clock, not the next number in a sequence: two branches open at once pick the same number and `main` stops loading once both merge. The four-digit `0001`–`0292` sequence is closed; ten-digit stamps sort above it |
| `run` | `go run ./cmd/api` on `:8080` — no db-up/migrate first |

### The `bench` lane — measurements, run by hand

`bench-perf`, `bench-perf-check`, `bench-record` and `bench-capture` all carry
`//go:build integration && bench`, so **no MERGE gate runs them**: not `make
check`, not the integration lane. They report
the numbers behind the budgets `acceptance-standards.md` publishes rather than
gating a merge on them, which is why each prints p50/p95/p99 beside its budget
instead of only passing or failing. `bench-mobile` below is the frontend half of
the same posture.

They are still **type-checked** on every `make check`: both golangci passes carry
the tag, and `gates/lintbuildtagreach_test.go` fails if either stops. That is load-bearing rather than
tidiness — nothing scheduled compiles these files, so without it a renamed helper
would break them silently and nobody would find out until the next person ran a
benchmark by hand and had to debug the harness instead of reading a number.

Each target's last step re-renders `docs/reference/performance-budgets.md` from
**every** committed record, not just the one it wrote — so a partial run still
leaves a complete page, with the rows it did not measure keeping their own dates
and their own machines. A budget no record covers renders as `not measured`
rather than being dropped, which is the whole reason the page lists the
published set instead of the measured one.

`bench-perf` is the one thing here a schedule touches, and only through
`bench-perf-check`. PERF-3/PERF-7 used to ride the standing integration lane at
the SMB tier as a canary; it stopped, because it was 37.9 s of every merge gate
— a quarter of its package — for a claim it could not make. A PERF-7 row
measured below mid-market renders `inconclusive`, never `within budget`: the
canary's number satisfies a bound it was not measured against. So the merge gate
paid a mid-market price for an SMB answer.

The weekly scheduled workflow now runs `bench-perf-check` on the SMB tier
instead, which is where drift nobody looks for gets found. Not mid-market: that
tier seeds 250k persons and 500k activities and does not finish inside `go
test`'s 30m budget (measured — SMB 46.6s, mid-market killed at 1800.7s on a fast
laptop), and a scheduled job that cannot finish does not report "slow", it goes
red and files an issue claiming a budget breach that was never measured. It
writes nothing:
`MARGINCE_BENCH_RECORD=1` is set by `bench-perf` alone, because publishing a
number stays a human's act — a machine must never write its own numbers into the
tree. The write-path regression the standing canary once caught by TIMING OUT
rather than by measuring is held deterministically now, by the `seq_scan` count
in `lastactivity_integration_test.go`.

## Root-only (frontend lane)

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `frontend-check` | The frontend gate, node-only: `fe-ds-gates`, `fe-drift`, `fe-lint`, `fe-unit`, `fe-build` in that order. It is spelled as those five legs rather than inline because CI runs them as three parallel jobs and both callers have to mean the same thing — `TestEveryLocalFrontendGateLegRunsInCI` fails if a leg added here reaches no CI job |
| `fe-ds-gates` | The design-system purity/font-lock/icon-glyph/spacing/spacing-role/space-token script gates, as one target. The native-control, extension-import and action-row gates are NOT here: they read the TypeScript AST and run in `fe-unit` with the rest of the vitest suite |
| `fe-drift` | The TS type-drift gate: `pnpm gen:api`, then fail if the committed `src/api/schema.d.ts` / `public-events.ts` moved |
| `fe-unit` | The vitest suite. `FE_COVERAGE=1` instruments it so the one run also writes `frontend/coverage/lcov.info` for the `sonarcloud` job — what CI passes, and about a third slower, which is why it is not the default a developer pays. On those runs `frontend/scripts/check-lcov-paths.sh` reads the report back before anything ships it: the scanner drops a path it cannot resolve in silence, so an unchecked lcov and an untested frontend look identical downstream (#1541) |
| `fe-clock-drift` | The same vitest suite, run as if it were `FE_CLOCK_SKEW_DAYS` (200) from now, and required to reach the same verdict. Not part of `frontend-check` and not a PR gate: the change that breaks these tests is the calendar rather than a diff, so it runs daily on `main` from `scheduled.yml`. It exists because three tests began failing on a date nobody edited anything on (#1977) — a fixture carried an absolute expiry the component compares to `now`. A grep cannot replace it: "an absolute date in a file that never pins the clock" matches 129 files here, nearly all harmless, and nothing static separates a date a component FORMATS from one it COMPARES |
| `fe-quality` | The CI aggregate: every leg of the gate except the unit suite and the bundle, plus the composed-SPA typecheck and the unit screens' suites. Needs a Go toolchain (it composes) |
| `fe-bundle` | The CI aggregate: `fe-build` + `fe-storybook` |
| `fe-install` / `fe-lint` / `fe-test` / `fe-build` / `fe-storybook` / `fe-format` / `fe-preview` | The individual frontend steps (`pnpm` wrappers) |
| `ds-purity` / `font-lock` / `icon-lint` / `ds-spacing` / `ds-spacing-roles` | The design-system script gates, runnable alone. The last two are the two halves of one rule: `ds-spacing` holds the vocabulary (a token, never a raw px, diff-scoped against the raw-px backlog) and `ds-spacing-roles` the grammar (in a context the design language names, the role rather than the rung — `var(--gapActions)` between two buttons, `var(--padCard)`/`var(--padPanel)` inside a surface), plus the rule that a screen never re-spaces a design-system primitive. The roles gate is whole-tree: that backlog was cleared to zero before it was armed |
| `native-controls` / `ext-imports` / `action-rows` | The source-wide gates that read the TypeScript AST rather than the text, so both run in `fe-unit` with the rest of the vitest suite; these targets exist to run one of them alone. `native-controls` refuses `<select>`, `<option>` or `<optgroup>` anywhere under `frontend/src` or an extension's frontend layer — there is no exemption, `design-system/select.tsx` included. `ext-imports` holds a unit's screen to `frontend/package.json`'s `exports` map and to what the unit's own `package.json` declares. `action-rows` holds that a container of two or more sibling buttons takes `gap: var(--gapActions)` — reading the markup for the row and the stylesheets for what its class gets, which is the only way to see a row that names a class no stylesheet defines. Their shared walk is `frontend/scripts/lib/source-tree.ts` |
| `gen-types` / `gen-types-check` | Aliases for backend `gen` / `drift` |
| `seed-dev` | API-seed the demo workspace against a running stack (idempotent), then the API-less extras (`seed-dev-db`) |
| `verify-boot` | Prove a running, seeded stack end to end: seeded-admin login, seeded people over `/v1`, frontend production build — pure client, fails loudly |
| `frontend-e2e` | The screen-acceptance UAT harness: AC-named tests + 390px sweep + axe WCAG 2.2 AA, against the built app over the seed mock (`BASE_URL=…` targets a live backend). Wired into CI as the `uat` job |
| `bench-mobile` | MOBILE-AC-2: record open p95 against the 300 ms **perceived** budget on a throttled Fast-3G profile at 390px (MOBILE-PARAM-2). The by-hand frontend measurement, which is what publishes the record: the `uat` lane keeps the structural claim without a number, because a single wall-clock sample there measures the runner. Switched on by `MARGINCE_BENCH_MOBILE=1`, which is what keeps the two runs from collecting each other's specs: `pnpm e2e` does not see `perf-mobile.spec.ts`, and this target sees nothing else |
| `bench-mobile-check` | The same measurement writing NOTHING — what the weekly scheduled workflow runs (`perf-mobile` in `scheduled.yml`). It clears `MARGINCE_BENCH_RECORD` rather than leaving it unset, for the reason `bench-perf-check` states: writing nothing must be a property of the target and not of whatever the caller's shell exported. This is what gives PERF-1's perceived budget a heartbeat; `bench-mobile` remains the only thing that publishes a number |
| `storybook` | The component workbench on `:6006` — the design-system catalog and the story surface `fe-uat` renders. Stories live beside their component as `<name>.stories.tsx` |
| `fe-uat` | Change-scoped Storybook render+capture UAT for frontend-only diffs: renders THIS branch's changed component's stories in headless Chromium and screenshots them (no live stack, no DB). Fails on an unclean render, an unregistered story, or a changed component with no story. Artifact: `.tmp/fe-uat/manifest.json`. Deliberately **not** in `make check` — the fe-only UAT lane a coordinator runs instead of the full stack. `ARGS="--allow-missing"` |

## One stack per worktree

`make dev` runs a full stack that will not collide with another worktree's: the
ONE shared infra (Postgres/Redis/MinIO on `15432`/`16379`/`29000`), but a private
database, a private **Redis logical database**, a private object bucket, and its
own api/FE port pair.

Nothing has to be passed for that. A **linked worktree** derives its slug from
its own directory name, so `.claude/worktrees/cfg-retire` gets
`margince_dev_cfg-retire`. The **primary worktree** keeps the shared `margince`
database, Redis db 0 and the app on the base `:8080`, because `make migrate`,
`make seed-dev` and `make verify-boot` all target that database by name.
`DEV_SLUG=<slug>` overrides the derived name when you want a second stack inside
one worktree.

Logs, pids and claims live under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/margince/dev/<slug>/`
(`~/.local/state/...` by default), and the primary worktree's stack — which has
no slug — uses `_base/` there. **One directory per machine, not per worktree**:
that is load-bearing rather than tidy, because the registry below is only a
registry if every worktree reads the same one. `DEV_SLUG=_base` is refused for
the same reason, since it would land a second stack on the primary's own state.

Every script that needs those paths gets them from `scripts/lib-devstate.sh`
rather than composing them — `make dev-logs` spent one revision of this change
looking for a file `make dev` no longer wrote, and reporting it as "is the stack
up?".

**The Redis index is isolation, not tidiness.** The stream names and consumer
groups are constants (`gw:events:crm:*`, `cg:*`), so two stacks on one index
share one consumer group: whichever worker reads an entry first consumes it,
resolves it against its OWN Postgres, finds nothing, and acks. The other
stack's event is gone, and a projection or accrual that never runs looks
exactly like a broken feature — it cost a day and a wrongly-filed critical bug
once.

The instance serves 80 databases in three blocks: **0** is the primary
worktree's stack, **1–63** the parallel integration lane (one per package, which
`FLUSHDB`s), and **64–79** per-worktree stacks. A stack takes the lowest free
index in its block, claimed under a lock and recorded in the machine-global
registry, so restarting reclaims its own index and two stacks never share one. A
17th concurrent stack is refused rather than doubled up.

**Ports are claimed the same way, from 8081–8179 (api at +10000).** They used to
be derived from `8080 + cksum(slug) % 1000`, and two hashes differing by a
multiple of the block size took different ports and the SAME Redis database — a
collision the port check could not see. A claim also skips a port some unrelated
process is listening on, which a hash cannot.

`make dev-stop [DEV_SLUG=<slug>] [DROP=1]` stops **this worktree's** stack;
`DROP=1` also drops its per-slug database, never the shared `margince`.

`make dev-sweep [DROP=1]` clears **every** stack on the machine — every
api/worker/vite, recorded, orphaned, or belonging to another worktree — and is
the only thing that does. It used to be what a bare `make dev` did on the way up,
which made the routine command the destructive one: it killed every parallel
session's stack and dropped databases another agent was mid-test against.

## The API is a compiled binary, and Vite is not

`make dev` runs two very different things. Vite hot-reloads the frontend, so a
change under `frontend/src/` is in your browser by the time you have switched
windows. **The API does not hot-reload.** It is a compiled Go binary, so every
backend change — a new endpoint, a migration, a handler fix — needs `make dev`
again before it reaches the browser at all.

This is worth its own heading because of how it fails. The stale binary keeps
answering perfectly happily, so the SPA calls endpoints it has never heard of and
the app breaks in ways that look exactly like a bug in the code you just wrote. An
old server is indistinguishable from a broken feature.

The same shape catches you across branches, and this tree is often worked in
several worktrees at once. So before you trust **any** manual test, confirm both:

- `git branch --show-current` is the branch you think it is, and
- the **API** process was started *after* your last backend change. That is the
  one behind the app port — `:18080` for the primary worktree, a claimed port for
  a linked one, both printed by the startup banner. The app port itself is Vite,
  which hot-reloads, so its start time tells you nothing about the binary that
  does not.

Neither costs anything to check, and skipping them costs a debugging session.

## Root-only (craftsmanship gate)

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `test-craft-pin` | Prove the pinned craftsmanship gate is actually pinned: all four platform digests are real sha256s, the resolver yields the gate from its own cache path rather than something found on `PATH`, and the cached binary still matches its digest. A prerequisite of `craft-static`, so it runs wherever the gate runs and nowhere it does not — enrolling it in `ROOT_SCRIPT_GATES` would put a network fetch inside `make check-backend`, whose CI job otherwise never reaches the network and should not start failing on a download flake. It exists because the failure it catches is silent: a resolver that quietly fell back to some other `craft` would turn every craft lane green against an unknown rubric, and nothing downstream could tell |
| `craft-static` | Full deterministic craftsmanship sweep of `backend/`, `extensions/` and `fixtures/` (each a separate Go module, so `./...` never reaches the latter two), **strict**: BLOCKER and MAJOR findings both fail it, MINOR is advisory. Green — the backlog was cleared to arm this bar. The pre-push hook runs the same bar diff-scoped, and CI's `craftsmanship` job runs this target as a required check. Size ceilings: 80 code lines / 500 file lines for product code, 160 / 1000 for `*_test.go`; a comment-only line is not length, so this check agrees with golangci's `funlen` (`ignore-comments`). Every threshold has a flag: `--max-func-lines`, `--max-file-lines`, `--max-test-func-lines`, `--max-test-file-lines` |
| `test-desktop-launcher` | The desktop launcher's own suite. `desktop/launcher` is its own module and deliberately outside `go.work` — it supervises the shipped binaries as child processes rather than importing them — so neither the workspace nor `./...` inside `backend` can reach it, and its tests ran nowhere before this lane existed. Runs with `GOWORK=off`, as that module's `go.mod` requires. A `check-backend` prerequisite |
| `craft-residue` | Fail if any unresolved `CRAFT-FIX`/`CRAFT-DISPUTE` review-loop marker is left in the backend tree. CI's `craft-residue` job runs it on **every** non-draft change, docs included |
| `secret-scan` | No hardcoded credential reaches `main`: gitleaks over a clean `git archive HEAD` export, policy in `.gitleaks.toml`. Scans the committed tree, not the working tree — gitleaks ignores `.gitignore`, so an in-place scan would read a sibling worktree or your real `.env.local` and differ per machine. Installs nothing on your machine and needs no account: `scripts/gitleaks-pin.sh` fetches the version- and checksum-pinned scanner into `.tmp/` on first use, so the binary — and therefore the verdict — is the one CI's `secret-scan` job runs on every non-draft change |
| `test-api-entrypoint` | Prove `scripts/deploy/api-entrypoint.sh` writes the bootstrap admin credential **only** onto an unprovisioned installation, retires one a previous boot left, and refuses to start when its probe cannot answer. Stubs `margince-migrate`/`margince-api` on `PATH`, so it needs no container and no database. Every failure on that path is silent — a credential written to a live installation looks exactly like one that was not — and the entrypoint runs where nobody is watching. CI runs it beside the secret gate |
| `test-dev-dsn` | Prove `scripts/dev.sh` resolves its DSNs through the same names the binaries read (`MARGINCE_OWNER_DSN` / `MARGINCE_DSN`) after an explicit `OWNER_DSN`/`APP_DSN` argument, still names the database itself so a `DEV_SLUG` stack cannot land on the base one, carries a query string like `?sslmode=require` across the swap, and never echoes a DSN. Pure shell — no Docker, no database |
| `test-dev-isolation` | Prove two worktrees get two stacks: the slug is derived from the worktree, the Redis logical database and the port pair are CLAIMED from one machine-global registry rather than hashed, a port with a foreign listener is skipped, an exhausted block is refused rather than doubled up, and the integration lane's template is per worktree. Pure shell — no Docker, no database |
| `test-secret-scan` | Prove `secret-scan` still catches: plant a credential-shaped token in each file `.gitleaks.toml` exempts, and require the scan to fail anyway. An over-broad allowlist reports "no leaks found" exactly like a clean tree — this is the only thing that tells them apart. CI runs it right after the scan |
| `test-sbom-sign` | Prove `sbom-sign` signs what is unsigned and skips what already carries a bundle at least as new as itself. A Rekor entry is permanent and cannot be retracted, so a re-run that signs again leaves the first entry corroborating nothing — and a run that re-signs everything looks exactly like a clean one. cosign is stubbed; what is under test is which files reach it |
| `check-craft-doc` | Assert AGENTS.md still carries its `## Craftsmanship` section — a cheap doc floor so the gate's rules cannot be silently unpinned from the rulebook. A `check-backend` prerequisite |

## Root-only (SBOM / supply chain)

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sbom` | Generate the three source-tree SBOMs (CycloneDX + SPDX 2.2.1 + SPDX 3.0) from a clean `git archive HEAD` export, license-enriched, then normalize and parity-check them. syft/grant/cosign run as digest-pinned Docker images; `jq`, `git` and `tar` run on the host. License enrichment queries the Go module proxy and npm registry, so the run needs network |
| `sbom-normalize` / `sbom-parity` | Reconcile syft's three writers to one repo-relative file set / assert all three enumerate it identically. `sbom` runs both; parity fails the build on any diff |
| `sbom-check` | The license gate — grant against `.grant.yaml` (16 allowed licenses, `require-license` and `require-known-license` both on). Reads the CycloneDX document only |
| `sbom-validate` | Validate each document against its own format — CycloneDX via `cyclonedx validate`, SPDX 2.2.1 via a hash-pinned `pyspdxtools`, SPDX 3.0.1 via the vendored schema in `sbom-schemas/`. Parity proves the three agree; this proves each is well-formed |
| `sbom-sign` | Keyless cosign signature per SBOM (`*.cosign.bundle`); needs an OIDC token, so in practice CI's isolated `sign` job. Depends on `sbom-parity`, never on `sbom` — a signature must cover normalized bytes that already agree |

Full detail: [supply-chain.md](supply-chain.md). This lane is **not** part of `make check`.

## Root-only (desktop build, macOS arm64)

Builds the self-contained folder that runs the whole stack with no Docker.
Output lands in `build/desktop/` (git-ignored). Not part of `make check`, and
not run in CI.

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `desktop` | **The whole folder**, at `build/desktop/margince/` (~128 MB). Reuses an already-built Postgres and event bus — `desktop-deps` builds each only when its output is missing, so a routine app rebuild takes seconds instead of paying the ~5-minute Postgres compile again |
| `desktop-rebuild` | Force everything, Postgres and the bus included |
| `desktop-postgres` | The relocatable Postgres 16 + pgvector + contrib (~5 min). Compiles from pinned, checksummed source, rewrites the Mach-O load commands to `@rpath`, re-signs every patched binary (arm64 refuses one whose signature `install_name_tool` invalidated), and fails if anything still links to `/opt/homebrew`, `/usr/local`, or the staging prefix. **Rerun after bumping the pinned versions** in `desktop/build/build-postgres.sh` |
| `desktop-valkey` | The event bus — Valkey, the BSD-licensed drop-in, since Redis 7.4+ ships under RSALv2/SSPL and this binary is redistributed inside a BUSL-1.1 product |
| `desktop-app` | `api`, `worker`, `migrate` (through `build/composition/`, so the enabled `extensions/` units are linked — a bare `go build` would silently ship without them), the frontend, and the launcher |
| `desktop-dist` | Assemble `build/desktop/margince/` and verify every binary's signature. Signing happens in staging, never here: `codesign` reads a folder holding a same-named executable plus a `resources/` subdirectory as a legacy bundle |
| `desktop-clean` | Remove `build/desktop/` entirely |

The built folder cannot run from `build/desktop/` — that path already exceeds
the 103-byte unix socket limit. Copy it somewhere shorter first. How-to:
[build-the-desktop-app.md](../how-to/build-the-desktop-app.md); the why:
[desktop-distribution.md](../explanation/desktop-distribution.md).

## Root-only (desktop build, Windows x64)

The same folder for Windows, at `build/desktop/margince-windows/`. **These
targets must run ON Windows** and shell out to `desktop/build/*.ps1` through
`pwsh`: pgvector has no build system other than `nmake` against MSVC, and the
event bus needs the MSYS2 toolchain, so neither half cross-builds from macOS.
A Windows host is not required to have GNU make, which is why
`desktop/build/build-windows.ps1` is the primary entry point and these are the
convenience wrapper.

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `desktop-win` | **The whole folder.** Stages Postgres and the bus only when they are missing, so a routine app rebuild does not re-download a 310 MB archive or recompile Redis |
| `desktop-win-rebuild` | Force everything, Postgres and the bus included |
| `desktop-win-postgres` | Pin, verify and unpack the upstream PostgreSQL 16 zip, then compile pgvector against it with MSVC and prune to the server tree. Windows resolves DLLs from the loading executable's own directory, so unlike macOS there is nothing to relocate — the compile is only pgvector, which no prebuilt Windows binary provides. **Needs the Visual Studio C++ workload** |
| `desktop-win-bus` | The event bus — Redis 7.2, the last BSD-3 line before the RSALv2/SSPL relicense and the lineage Valkey forked from, since Valkey has no Windows build. Compiled from pinned source under MSYS2, whose runtime DLL travels beside it with its licence. **Needs MSYS2 + `base-devel gcc`** |
| `desktop-win-app` | `api`, `worker`, `migrate` (through `build/composition/`, so the enabled `extensions/` units are linked), the frontend, and the launcher. No signing step: Authenticode needs a purchased certificate, so the first launch warns through SmartScreen |
| `desktop-win-dist` | Assemble the folder and **run each third-party binary out of it** — the Windows equivalent of the macOS signature check, and the only way a missing DLL is caught here rather than on the user's machine |

`desktop-clean` removes `build/desktop/` for both platforms.

## Variables

`GO`, `PG_PORT` (15432), `REDIS_PORT` (16379), `DB_NAME` (margince),
`OWNER_DSN`, `APP_DSN` — all overridable (`make migrate PG_PORT=5432`).
The Makefile exports `MARGINCE_ENV=dev` and the `MARGINCE_TEST_*`
variables so tests find the dev containers.

`make dev` resolves each DSN in the product's own order — an explicit
`OWNER_DSN`/`APP_DSN` argument, else `MARGINCE_OWNER_DSN`/`MARGINCE_DSN` (what
the binaries themselves read), else the compose default. It passes the result as
an explicit `--dsn`, which is why the resolution happens in the script: `--dsn`
outranks the environment, so a value set in `.env.local` was inert for the whole
dev stack before this.

Two things the stack keeps for itself whatever DSN it is handed. It **names the
database**, so `DEV_SLUG=x` reaches `margince_dev_x` on its claimed ports and
never the base database a supplied DSN happened to name. And `--fresh` still
refuses when the effective owner DSN is not the compose Postgres, because it
drops through the compose container while migrations follow the DSN. A query
string (`?sslmode=require`) survives the swap; a libpq `host=… dbname=…` DSN is
refused, since a database segment that is not there cannot be replaced.
