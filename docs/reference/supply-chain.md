# Supply chain — SBOMs, license gate, signatures

An **SBOM** (software bill of materials) is a machine-readable inventory of
everything the tree ships — every dependency, its version, and its license.
Three tools run this lane, all as digest-pinned Docker images: **syft**
generates the SBOMs, **grant** gates their licenses, and **cosign** signs them.

```text
git archive HEAD ─▶ syft ─▶ 3 SBOM docs ─▶ normalize ─▶ parity ──┬─▶ grant (license gate)
                                                                 ├─▶ validate (per-format)
                                                                 └─▶ cosign (main only,
                                                                     needs parity + validate)
```

The SBOM lane covers the whole repo (backend + frontend + extensions), so its
targets live in the **root** `Makefile` rather than being delegated to
`backend/`. It is **not** part of `make check`: CI runs it as its own workflow,
`.github/workflows/sbom.yml`, on manual dispatch only. The dependency-license
policy still runs automatically on every PR that touches a dependency — as the
`license gate` job in `ci.yml`, not here.

Everything here describes the **source tree**, not a container image: the scan
input is the committed content of `HEAD`.

## What is produced

`make sbom` exports `git archive HEAD` into `.tmp/sbom-src/`, points syft at
that export, and deletes it again on the way out (a shell `trap`). Scanning an
export rather than the working tree is the reason host state — `node_modules`,
`.env`, editor files, an uncommitted experiment — can never leak into an SBOM,
and it makes the committed content of `HEAD` the single authority on what is
scanned. (`.gitignore` is not that authority: it does not remove a file already
tracked in `HEAD`, and `git add -f` can commit an ignored one.)

One scan, three documents:

| File | Format | syft writer |
|---|---|---|
| `sboms/margince.cdx.json` | CycloneDX JSON | `cyclonedx-json` |
| `sboms/margince.spdx221.json` | SPDX JSON 2.2.1 | `spdx-json@2.2` |
| `sboms/margince.spdx300.json` | SPDX JSON 3.0 | `spdx-json@3.0` |

`/sboms/` is gitignored — these are build artifacts CI publishes, never
committed.

Scan policy lives in [`.syft.yaml`](../../.syft.yaml); the Makefile owns the
"what is scanned" policy (the clean export), the config owns the rest:

- `source.name: margince`. syft has **no** `source.license` key, so the primary
  component's own license cannot be set from config — Margince's source license
  (BUSL-1.1) is handled on the grant side instead.
- `enrich: [all]` with `license.content: none` — license metadata is pulled from
  the Go module proxy and the npm registry, so **`make sbom` needs network
  access**. It is not an offline scan.
- `file.metadata.selection: all`, digests `sha1` + `sha256` + `sha512`. syft's
  default (`owned-by-package`) hashes only files a cataloger attributed to a
  discovered package, which would leave first-party source (`backend/**`,
  `frontend/src/**`, migrations, config templates) with no checksum at all.
  SHA-1 is kept because SPDX file entries historically key on it; SHA-256 and
  SHA-512 are what a consumer actually verifies.
- **No `exclude:` list**, on purpose. The constellation dist release gate rejects
  a release unless the SBOM attests every file the release patch adds or
  modifies, and that patch is a full committed-tree diff with no excludes — so
  the SBOM file set must equal the whole committed tree. Excluding any committed
  tree here (CI workflows, `fixtures`, `sbom-schemas`, …) would make
  a commit touching it fail that gate. Uncommitted host state is already absent
  because the scan runs on `git archive HEAD`, so there is nothing left to
  exclude.

## Versioning

`SBOM_VERSION` is passed to syft as `--source-version`, so it travels **inside**
each document rather than only in a filename — which is what puts it under
cosign's signature.

```make
SBOM_VERSION ?= $(shell git describe --tags --exact-match 2>/dev/null || echo "dev-$$(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)")
```

- **HEAD exactly on a tag** ⇒ the tag alone. A tag maps to one commit, so the
  revision is implicit.
- **Otherwise** ⇒ `dev-<full git revision>`, so a published pre-release SBOM is
  traceable to its exact commit.
- `--exact-match` is load-bearing: plain `git describe` would fall back to the
  nearest tag in its `-N-g<sha>` form, and this repo carries non-release tags
  (`archive/*`) that would then read as a release version.
- Overridable on the command line (`make sbom SBOM_VERSION=v1.3.0`); the LICENSE
  stamping that accompanies a real tag is a separate rule, see
  [license-release-rule.md](license-release-rule.md).

## The one-tree invariant

The three documents must describe **one** tree. syft's three writers do not
agree about the file set out of the box, for one scan:

- **CycloneDX** names every file with the absolute scan-root prefix
  (`/src/.tmp/sbom-src/`); **SPDX** names are repo-relative.
- Both **SPDX** writers additionally emit a pseudo-entry per **directory** —
  whose only checksum is the zero SHA-1 — plus one **empty-name** scan-root
  entry. CycloneDX emits neither.

`make sbom-normalize` reconciles them: strip the prefix from CycloneDX file
components, and drop the empty-name / zero-SHA-1 entries from both SPDX
documents, leaving all three enumerating the same repo-relative regular files.
It runs on the syft output **before any signature**, so the signed bytes are the
normalized bytes. Both filters are idempotent, so re-running — or a future syft
that already emits relative names and no directory entries — is a no-op.

The zero SHA-1 is the discriminator because it is the only signal syft gives:
v1.50 labels **every** SPDX element `software_fileKind == "file"`, directories
included, so the kind field cannot single a directory out. A real file always
carries a non-zero SHA-256/512 alongside its SHA-1.

`make sbom-parity` is the assertion. It extracts the three file-name sets —
`.components[]|select(.type=="file")|.name`, `.files[].fileName`, and
`.["@graph"][]|select(.type=="software_File")|.name` — sorts each, and diffs
them pairwise. Green prints `OK: three SBOMs list the same <n> files`; any
difference prints the diff and **fails the build**. So a syft upgrade that
reintroduces the scan-root prefix or the directory entries breaks here, loudly,
rather than silently at release validation. `make sbom` runs normalize then
parity itself, and CI runs `make sbom`, so every CI run is guarded.

## The license gate

`make sbom-check` runs **grant** against the CycloneDX document only:

```bash
grant check sboms/margince.cdx.json -c .grant.yaml
```

[`.grant.yaml`](../../.grant.yaml) sets `require-license: true` and
`require-known-license: true`, so a package with **no** detected license, or one
grant cannot resolve, denies just as an unallowed license does.

The allowlist — sixteen identifiers, exactly as configured:

| Group | Identifiers |
|---|---|
| Baseline permissive | `Apache-2.0`, `MIT`, `BSD-2-Clause`, `BSD-3-Clause`, `ISC`, `0BSD`, `Zlib`, `BSL-1.0`, `CC0-1.0` |
| Present in the tree, added to cover it | `MIT-0`, `BlueOak-1.0.0`, `MPL-2.0` |
| Maintainer decision | `CC-BY-4.0`, `Python-2.0`, `Unlicense` |
| Margince's own source license | `BUSL-1.1` |

Two categories never reach the allowlist check:

- **First-party packages** are ignored by coordinate (`ignore-packages`):
  `github.com/margince/margince/*` (our own Go modules) and
  `example.margince.dev/*` (the committed extension stubs, ADR-0120). They carry
  no third-party license to gate.
- **Local composite actions** under `.github/actions/` are ignored by coordinate
  too (`./.github/actions/*`). They are first-party files carrying the repo's own
  BUSL-1.1, and they cannot be handled the way the pinned third-party actions
  are: syft assigns a local action **no purl at all**, while
  `make sbom-supplement` keys its map on purl, so the map cannot reach them. The
  entry is globbed so the next composite action is covered on the day it is added
  rather than the day it turns the gate red.

Everything else must still resolve to a known, allowed license.

## Schema validation

Parity proves the three documents describe the same tree. It does **not** prove
any of them is a valid document of its own format — so `make sbom-validate`
checks each against its format, with the validator that format actually has:

| Document | Validator |
|---|---|
| `margince.cdx.json` | `cyclonedx validate --fail-on-errors` |
| `margince.spdx221.json` | `pyspdxtools`, from a hash-pinned requirements file |
| `margince.spdx300.json` | `jsonschema` against the vendored `sbom-schemas/spdx-3.0.1.schema.json` |

`make sbom-sign` depends on `sbom-parity` **and** `sbom-validate`, so a document
that is internally inconsistent or malformed cannot be signed — a signature over
a broken SBOM is worse than no signature, because it makes the broken thing look
vouched for. The SPDX 3.0.1 schema is vendored rather than fetched so the check
is reproducible and cannot change under a release; `sbom-schemas/README.md`
records its provenance.

## Signing

`make sbom-sign` keyless-signs each of the three documents with cosign
(`sign-blob --yes --bundle`), producing one bundle per SBOM:

- `sboms/margince.cdx.json.cosign.bundle`
- `sboms/margince.spdx221.json.cosign.bundle`
- `sboms/margince.spdx300.json.cosign.bundle`

It **requires an OIDC token** — `SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN`, or GitHub's
`ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` / `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN`, which are
ambient in a job holding `id-token: write`. All three are forwarded into the
container.

The target depends on **`sbom-parity`, not `sbom`**, and that is deliberate in
both directions. The signature must cover normalized, mutually agreeing bytes,
so something has to re-check them — parity does that cheaply and refuses to sign
a stale or un-normalized set. But re-running *generation* here would run the
syft scan while the signing token is in scope, which is precisely the isolation
the CI workflow exists to enforce (below); in CI the signing job consumes the
generation job's artifact instead.

## Toolchain posture

syft, grant and cosign all run as **digest-pinned Docker images**, so the host
needs none of them installed and a registry tag re-push cannot swap the tool
that reads the repo or the one that holds a signing identity. The tags in the
Makefile are comments next to the digest — **bump tag and digest together**.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SYFT_IMAGE` | `anchore/syft@sha256:1288ea4c…` (v1.50.0) | the scanner |
| `GRANT_IMAGE` | `anchore/grant@sha256:17246361…` (v0.6.8) | the license gate |
| `COSIGN_IMAGE` | `gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign@sha256:c77247c9…` (v2.4.3) | keyless signing |
| `SYFT` / `GRANT` / `COSIGN` | `docker run --rm -v "$(CURDIR)":/src -w /src <image>` | override the **whole** invocation to use host binaries: `make sbom SYFT=syft GRANT=grant` |
| `SBOM_VERSION` | tag, else `dev-<revision>` | see [Versioning](#versioning) |
| `SBOM_DIR` | `sboms` | output directory |
| `SBOM_SRC` | `.tmp/sbom-src` | the clean-export scratch path (created and removed per run) |
| `COSIGN_HOME` | `.tmp/cosign-home` | cosign's `HOME` inside the container |

The host does still need **Docker**, **git**/**tar** (the clean export) and
**jq** (normalization and parity run on the host), plus **network access** for
license enrichment.

**cosign runs as the invoking user, with a relocated `HOME`.** The cosign image
defaults to uid 65532, which owns neither the bind-mounted `sboms/` directory
nor a writable home. So the invocation adds `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` and
`HOME=/src/.tmp/cosign-home`:

- **uid** — cosign writes each `*.cosign.bundle` mode `0600`. Written as uid
  65532 those bundles would be unreadable to whatever consumes them next; as the
  invoking user they stay readable (in CI, `upload-artifact` runs as the same
  non-root runner).
- **HOME** — sigstore's TUF cache needs somewhere to land; pointing it at the
  gitignored `.tmp/` keeps it out of the tree.

## CI — `.github/workflows/sbom.yml`

Regenerates, license-gates and signs the SBOMs. **Manual dispatch only** — there
is no automatic trigger at all. The runner needs only Docker, which
`ubuntu-latest` pre-installs.

| Trigger | Condition |
|---|---|
| `workflow_dispatch` | manual, any ref (but see the `sign` job's own guard) |

There is no path filter, because there is no filtered trigger to apply it to.

**Why the `main` push trigger went away.** It fired on every dependency-set
change that landed, about 48 runs a week, each drawing on the same org-wide
ceiling of 20 concurrent runners that the PR gates queue in — where a starved
lane delays a verdict somebody is waiting on. Nothing consumed the output at that
cadence: this repository has no releases yet, so every run published bundles for
a tree no consumer would fetch and signed it into the public Rekor log, where a
keyless signature is permanent and cannot be retracted. Generating and signing
an artifact stream nobody reads is the cost without the benefit.

**No license enforcement was lost with it.** The gate that decides whether a
dependency may land is `license gate` in `ci.yml`, job-gated on the `deps` scope,
and `main` only ever receives a dependency change through a PR that passed it.
What stopped happening on `main` is artifact publication and signing — both of
which describe a release, and are one dispatch away when there is one to
describe.

The license gate lives in `ci.yml` rather than here for a reason worth keeping
even now that this workflow has no filter of its own: a workflow-level `paths:`
filter produces no check run when it does not match, and a required context that
never posts blocks a merge forever — so a gate that must be required cannot live
behind one. Job-level gating reports a path skip as passing instead. See
[ci-pipeline.md](../explanation/ci-pipeline.md).

Workflow-level `permissions: contents: read` is the floor for every job. The
OIDC minting credential is **not** granted there — only the `sign` job requests
it, so branch-controlled generation code can never mint a signing token.

**Job `sbom`** — checks out with `persist-credentials: false` and
`fetch-depth: 0` (resolving an exact tag needs tags and history), then runs
`make sbom`, then `make sbom-check`. The license gate stays on this path because
it is the precondition for `sign` below. Publishes the `sboms` artifact from
`sboms/` with `if-no-files-found: error` and 90-day retention.

**Job `sign`** — `needs: sbom`, and gated to `push` (which the trigger already
restricts to `main`) or a `workflow_dispatch` on `refs/heads/main`. It adds
`id-token: write` to `contents: read`, downloads the `sboms` artifact rather
than regenerating it, runs `make sbom-sign`, and publishes `sboms/*.cosign.bundle`
as the `sbom-signatures` artifact (retention 90 days).

Two reasons it is a separate job and **never runs off `main`**:

1. **A keyless signature is permanent.** It lands in the public Rekor
   transparency log and cannot be retracted. A dispatch from a feature branch
   must never produce one.
2. **Isolation from branch-controlled code.** Generation runs whatever the
   branch's `Makefile` and `.syft.yaml` say; keeping that out of any job holding
   `id-token: write` is what stops branch-controlled code from reaching the
   signing identity. `needs: sbom` also means the license gate has already
   passed, so a policy-failing SBOM never reaches signing — which is why that
   gate stays in this workflow even though `ci.yml` already gates every PR.

## Targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sbom` | Generate the three source-tree SBOMs from a clean `git archive HEAD` export into `sboms/`, license-enriched (needs network), then run `sbom-normalize` and `sbom-parity`. Signing is deliberately not part of it |
| `sbom-normalize` | Reconcile syft's three writers onto one file set — strip CycloneDX's absolute scan-root prefix, drop the SPDX directory / empty-name pseudo-entries. Idempotent; runs before any signature so the signed bytes are the normalized bytes |
| `sbom-parity` | Assert all three SBOMs enumerate the identical set of repo-relative files; prints `OK: three SBOMs list the same <n> files` or fails with the diff |
| `sbom-check` | The license gate: `grant check sboms/margince.cdx.json -c .grant.yaml`. Denies an unallowed, unknown, or missing license; first-party coordinates are ignored and CI Actions never enter the scan |
| `sbom-sign` | Keyless cosign `sign-blob` per SBOM → `*.cosign.bundle`. Needs an OIDC token. Depends on `sbom-parity`, not `sbom`, so it re-checks rather than regenerates — and so generation never runs under the signing token |

Every one of these except `sbom` fails fast with
`FAIL: no SBOM found — run 'make sbom' first` when `sboms/margince.cdx.json` is
absent.
