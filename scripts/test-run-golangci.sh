# that only looks at the case it was written for. Both directions are asserted
# here, and the case that separates them is deliberately awkward —
# `extensions/openchannel` reports as `../extensions/openchannel/...`, a path
# that leads with `..` and is entirely
# inside the repo. A guard that looked for `../` instead of resolving the path
# would pass every other case in this file and quarantine the whole module.
#
# golangci-lint is stubbed on PATH, so no case runs a linter or touches the real
# analysis cache — the fixtures are its text output, which is the only input the
