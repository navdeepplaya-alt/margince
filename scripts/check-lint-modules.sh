# golangci-lint over the Go modules the backend lint lane cannot reach.
#
# `make -C backend lint` runs `golangci-lint run ./...` from backend/, and
# `./...` stops at the module boundary. The repo has eleven Go modules; that
# pattern covers exactly one. The other ten — backend/tools, composition, the
# units under extensions/, desktop/launcher, and the deliberately-broken
# fixtures/extensions/ — were linted by nothing. Not by CI, not by `make check`,
# not by the pre-push hook, which only sees the craft gate. That is how an
# unformatted file reached main with every gate green (extjobs.go), and the
# formatting was the visible half: the same blind spot was also hiding two
# swallowed errors, two misspellings and nine staticcheck findings.
#
# Every module is linted against the SAME backend/.golangci.yml. One config is
# the point: a per-module config would have to restate the baseline (golangci
# has no config inheritance), and a second copy of a shared bar drifts from it.
# Where a baseline rule genuinely does not fit a build-time generator, the
# waiver is `//nolint:<linter> // <reason>` on the line it applies to — which
# the config's own forbidigo comment establishes as the sanctioned escape hatch,
# and which keeps the justification next to the code instead of in a path list
# that outlives whatever it was written for.
#
# The module list is derived from tracked go.mod files, so a new module is
# covered the day it is committed. `backend` itself is the one exclusion, and
# not an arbitrary one: it is the module the backend lane already lints twice
# (baseline repo-wide, plus the strict new-code pass), so linting it again here
# would only slow the gate down to reprint the same findings.

# `backend` is the product module, which the backend lane already lints twice
# (baseline repo-wide + the strict new-code pass); repeating it here would only
# slow the gate down to reprint the same findings.
#
# `fixtures/` cannot be type-checked at all outside the harness that uses it.
# Those units import backend/pkg/extension while declaring no require for it —
# deliberately, because a fixture must not join the real build — so they resolve
# only inside the temporary workspace the tests compose for them. golangci needs
# a type-checkable package; it has nothing to say here. They are NOT unchecked
# code: the craftsmanship gate, the license header test and the tree-wide gofmt gate all
# cover fixtures/, and none of the three needs to typecheck to do its job.

# Two plain substitutions rather than one optional-slash pattern: `\?` is a GNU
# extension, and the BSD sed macOS ships reads it as a literal `?`, so a pattern
# that strips the suffix on CI leaves it in place on a laptop. Both dialects
# agree on these two.

# composition stub, the fixtures/extensions/ units, which are standalone by
# design so a broken fixture cannot break the real build) must be linted with

# golangci exits 1 when it RAN and found issues, and non-1 when it could not run
# at all — an unreadable config, a workspace that does not resolve, an internal

# 1 for that too, which is how one path bug came to announce itself as findings
# in eight modules nothing had ever entered, under a remedy explaining how to fix
# findings that did not exist. So the cd gets a reserved status of its own, well
# outside the range golangci uses, and the run's exit is read rather than merely
# tested.
#
# The fourth is the same shape one layer down, and reaches here as the wrapper's
# own status: golangci RAN, and reported issues its machine-wide cache remembers
# from a different worktree — against that worktree's paths, and so without the
# waivers those paths carry. Findings in files this checkout does not contain,
