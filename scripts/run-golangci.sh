# run-golangci.sh — run golangci-lint, and tell a finding in THIS checkout apart
# from one its cache remembers from another.
#
# golangci-lint's analysis cache is per MACHINE (~/Library/Caches/golangci-lint,
# ~/.cache/golangci-lint on Linux), shared by every checkout on it, and keyed by
# file CONTENT rather than by path. This repo is worked in several git worktrees
# at once by design, so the same unchanged file exists at several absolute paths
# with ONE cache entry between them — and that entry keeps the path of whichever
# worktree filled it first. A run in a second worktree gets a cache hit and
# re-reports the issues against the first worktree's path.
#
# That is not cosmetic, which is the part that costs the time. Two of golangci's
# processors decide whether an issue is REPORTED by reading its path:
#
#   - the nolint processor opens the file at that path to find the `//nolint:`
#     directives that waive it. A path in another worktree — deleted, or simply
#     not this one — is a file it cannot associate with the run, so every
#     in-source waiver stops applying and the findings under it come back.
#   - `.golangci.yml`'s exclusion rules match the path as reported, anchored to
#     the config file's own directory (`^tools/`, `^\.\./extensions/`). A foreign
#     path matches neither, so the path-scoped exemptions stop applying too.
#
# The run then prints findings this tree has waived, in files it does not
# contain, under a header naming modules it does contain — on a branch that may
# not have touched Go at all. Every part of that reads as a real failure except
# the `../../` on the front of the paths, which is the easiest thing on the
# screen to skim past. Three times in one session (issue #1378) the first read
# was "my branch broke these modules", and the remedy printed underneath — fix
# the finding — cannot be followed, because the file is somewhere else.
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES: an issue reported against a file outside this checkout. It
# says what that is and prints the one command that clears it, instead of
# leaving the findings to read as the named module's own. Exit code 40 marks the
# case so a caller can tell it from real findings (exit 1).
#
# Note what the finding IS, since "false positive" is the wrong word for it: the
# cache hit means the content is byte-identical, so the finding is true ABOUT THE
# CODE. What is wrong is the path, and with the path go the waivers that were
# written for it. Clearing the cache is therefore the whole fix — the findings do
# not come back with local paths, they go away, because locally they are waived.
#
# AND the cache is partitioned per checkout, unless the caller has already
# chosen one: with several worktrees linting concurrently by design, one shared
# cache is both the stale-path source above and a file two sessions write at
# once. Each checkout gets its own directory, keyed by its absolute path, under
# ~/.cache/golangci-lint/ — INSIDE golangci's default Linux cache root
# deliberately, because ci.yml's "Cache the golangci-lint analysis cache" step
# saves and restores exactly that directory, and a partition outside it would
# silently turn every CI lint cold. The cost is one cold analysis per new
# worktree; the detector below stays armed for a caller who points
# GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE somewhere shared anyway. Clearing a stale cache remains
# the human's call, for the reason it always was: destructive to a resource
# other sessions may be using.
