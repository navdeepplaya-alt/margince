# Parallel integration-test runner.
#
# The serial lane runs every integration package with `go test -p 1` against ONE
# shared database, because parallel packages racing on the same DB collide on the
# schema each test rebuilds. That serialization is the only reason for -p 1 — the
# suites are I/O-bound (mostly idle on Postgres round-trips and TLS handshakes in
# the HTTP e2e), so the CPU sits unused while one package runs.
#
# This runner removes the shared-state constraint instead of the serialization.
# Each package gets private throwaway state, so concurrent packages share nothing:
#   Postgres — its own empty clone db (the Go harness migrates it once, then
#              resets the data between tests — see internal/platform/testdb).
#   MinIO    — a private bucket (MARGINCE_TEST_BLOBSTORE_BUCKET=<base>-p<idx>),
#              auto-created by the blobstore store.
#   Redis    — the one shared instance, but each package gets its own logical
#              db (MARGINCE_TEST_REDIS_DB, mapped 1..REDIS_DBS by slot), so no
#              two packages ever share a stream. Db 0 is reserved for `make dev`,
#              so a running dev stack and this lane never collide either. More
#              than one package touches Redis, and at least two FLUSHDB between
#              tests, so this is an isolation boundary rather than a convenience
#              — see the NPKGS guard below for what happens when it is short.
# Within a package nothing changes — still -p 1, the same sequential model that is
# green today — so no test file needs editing.
#
# Same teeth as the serial lane: zero-skip guard (a SKIP fails the run) and any
# package failure fails the whole run. MARGINCE_ENV=dev is exported so the HTTP
# e2e suites boot under the same non-production postures the serial lane uses.
#
# Shard mode (the CI matrix): INTEGRATION_SHARD="k/N" slices the lane across N
# independent runners BY TEST, not by package — package-level fan-out bottoms
# out at the heaviest package (compose/integration is minutes of serial tests),
# so each shard runs a deterministic round-robin slice of every package's
# top-level Test functions via -run. Discovery is static (`func Test…` in the
# package's *_test.go files) so it costs no compile; files under the known
# opt-in lane tags (e2e_llm, livesmoke, voicelive) and the by-hand benchmark lane
# (`integration && bench`) are skipped exactly as the compiler
# skips them, and any other constraint — an expression, or a lone tag the
# allowlist does not know (a satisfied built-in like linux or cgo would
# compile but never be sliced) — fails discovery loudly instead of being
# silently mis-sliced. Shard teeth on top of
# the lane's own: the set of
# tests a shard actually ran must equal its assigned slice, and
# scripts/test-integration-reconcile.sh re-checks the union across shards
# (complete + disjoint) before merging coverage — a slicing bug can only read
# as red, never as a quietly thinner lane.
#
# Env:
#   INTEGRATION_JOBS        max concurrent packages (default: min(nproc, 8))
#   INTEGRATION_SHARD       "k/N" → run the k-th of N test slices (CI matrix)
#   INTEGRATION_SHARD_OUT   shard mode only: directory receiving the manifests
#                           (discovery/assigned/ran/meta) and per-package binary
#                           covdata pods for the CI fan-in to reconcile + merge;
#                           coverage instrumentation is on iff this is set
#   INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT     per-package go-test timeout, as <seconds>s (default
#                           600s; the budget column parses this). Resolved in
#                           scripts/lib-testdb.sh, shared with the one-package lane
#   MARGINCE_TEST_DSN / MARGINCE_TEST_APP_DSN   owner + app DSNs (Makefile defaults)
#
# This lane also EXPORTS one variable to each package process, per slot rather
# than for the run: MARGINCE_TEST_CLONE_DB names the throwaway clone that slot
# just created. It is what lets testdb.EnsureSchema skip re-migrating a database
# this script copied from an already-migrated template — see testdb's CloneDBEnv
# for the four things it proves before taking the copy at its word, and why the
# variable carries the NAME rather than a flag. The serial lane deliberately
# does not set it: it runs on the template itself, where the rebuild is what
# keeps one package's residue out of every later clone.
