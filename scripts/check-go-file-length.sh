# Go file-length gate with a ratchet (plus a waiver list). A hand-written Go
# file above the cap is a god-file split candidate; generated (*_gen.go /
# *.gen.go) and test (*_test.go) files are exempt. The search root is backend/,
# so only product Go is in scope.
#
# The ratchet: scripts/go-file-length-waivers.txt records each pre-existing
# offender with its frozen line count. A waived file may shrink but never
# grow past its recorded count; once it drops to the cap or below, its entry
# must be REMOVED so the file is back under the hard cap for good.
#
# THE COUNT IS `wc -l`. The craftsmanship gate's large-file check holds this same
# cap over these same files, and its own line counter is written to answer the
# number this awk reads. Two gates over one cap that cannot share a
# helper across bash and Go, so each names the other: a file at exactly the cap
# must pass BOTH, which holds only while both count alike.
