# Test-lane separation.
#
# A unit test (one WITHOUT a `//go:build integration` or `//go:build livesmoke`
# tag, so it runs under `make test`) must never open a REAL Postgres/Redis
# connection. Anything that needs real infrastructure belongs in the
# integration lane. This keeps `make test` hermetic and kills the "DB test
# that silently degrades in the unit lane" anti-pattern.
#
# Fakes are fine and NOT flagged: in-memory fake sql drivers carry none of
# the markers below. If a miniredis-style fake (which does dial via
# redis.NewClient) ever joins the unit lane, narrow that marker then —
# deliberately, in this file — rather than pre-weakening the gate today.

# CODE, not prose. The markers above are grepped out of the file's TEXT, and a
# _test.go that merely NAMES one while explaining something is not opening a
# connection: "a single pgx.Connect" in a sentence about arithmetic was reported
# as a violation of a rule that file keeps. The workaround such a gate forces is
# worse than the miss — an author rewords a true comment to avoid a term, and
# the next reader learns that naming the thing is what is forbidden.
#
# So comments are stripped before the match. String literals are NOT, and that
# is the line: a DSN in a string is exactly the shape this gate looks for, and a
# stripper that spared strings would spare the violation.
# The stripper is its own file: an awk program inlined into a shell string has
# to survive two levels of quoting, and the version that did not was silently
# empty — which made this gate print OK over a tree it had not read. A file is
# read by awk itself, and its own test plants a violation to prove it.
