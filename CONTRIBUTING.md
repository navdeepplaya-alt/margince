# Contributing to Margince

Margince is source-available (BUSL-1.1) and AI-native: most of this code
is authored by agents under human accountability. Contributions are
welcome — held to the same craftsmanship bar as our own AI-authored code.

Participation is covered by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
which includes one clause specific to a repository built this way:
submitting volume you cannot explain is treated as disrespect for
reviewers' time, not as enthusiasm.

## Human accountability

**You are accountable for every line you submit, and must be able to
explain every line.** AI assistance is welcome and expected;
unexplainable, slop-flooded contributions are not. If you cannot explain
why a line is there, what it does, and why it is correct, it is not
ready. "The model wrote it" is not an answer to a review question.

This is the project's one non-negotiable. It is why we ask for the
disclosures below — not to discourage AI use, but to keep a human
answerable for the result.

## AI disclosure

Disclose AI involvement proportionately in the PR description:

- **Assisted** — you wrote/directed it with AI help (autocomplete,
  review, refactor). The default.
- **Generated** — AI produced substantial portions you then reviewed
  and own.

There is a deliberate **internal/external asymmetry**: Margince's own
build agents author by design and do not disclose per-PR (it is the
stated practice, A39); external contributors disclose so a human
reviewer knows what they are accountable for. Either way, the same
gates apply (below).

## A working tree in four commands

You need **Go ≥ 1.26**, **Docker**, `golangci-lint`, and Node with pnpm
for the frontend half. *Which* pnpm is not yours to pick: `package.json`
pins it in `packageManager`, and both Corepack and pnpm itself switch to
that version, so the repository decides rather than the day you installed.

```
make install    # FE deps, gate tools, and the git hooks — run once
make db-up      # PG16 + Redis 7 containers, and the app role
make migrate    # core + custom migrations
make dev        # the whole stack: the app on :8080, the api behind it, worker
```

Two things about `make dev` that save an hour of confusion. It starts
**this worktree's** stack and leaves every other one alone, so a second
checkout can run at the same time. (`make dev-sweep` is the machine-wide
clear, and the only thing that touches somebody else's stack.) And the API
is **compiled**: Vite hot-reloads the frontend, the binary does not, so
every backend change needs `make dev-stop && make dev`. Not `make dev`
alone — this worktree's stack still holds the ports, and the boot refuses
them rather than talking over a server from an older build. A stale binary
is indistinguishable from a broken feature.

Full target list: [docs/reference/make-targets.md](docs/reference/make-targets.md).

## Branch, commit, merge

- **Branch off `main`**: `git switch -c <type>/<slug> origin/main`.
  Direct pushes to `main` are blocked; there is no other path to merge.
- **Conventional commit subjects**, scoped to the module:
  `fix(overlay): a mirrored deal reports the incumbent's last-modified`.
  Write the subject as the behaviour after the change, not as the task
  you performed.
- **Squash-merge** is the house style, and only over green checks.

### Contributing from a fork

Be aware before you start: **a pull request from a fork cannot currently
be merged here.** One of the required checks is a SonarCloud analysis,
and its token is deliberately withheld from fork-triggered workflows, so
the check can never report and the merge stays blocked — a limitation of
our gate wiring, not a judgement about your change. If you plan more than
a drive-by fix, open an issue first and ask for write access so you can
push a branch in this repository instead. Small fixes are still welcome
as fork PRs; a maintainer will land them for you.

## The gates

Every change — code, docs, and config alike — lands through the same
loop your PR will run:

1. **`make check`** is the merge gate: build, vet, lint (baseline +
   new-code strict), arch-lint, unit + fitness tests, generated-code
   drift, contract breaking-change, test-lane hygiene, image pins, and
   the file-length ratchet. It already includes the frontend lane
   (`check-fe`), so there is nothing to add on top. `make test-integration`
   is the separate real-Postgres lane — tenant isolation, GDPR erasure,
   audit immutability (needs `make db-up`). It fails loudly without a
   database rather than skipping, because a skipped security gate looks
   exactly like a passing one.
2. The **craftsmanship gate** (`craft static --strict`) runs
   diff-scoped on every push once hooks are installed (`make hooks`):
   new or touched backend code must be free of `BLOCKER` **and**
   `MAJOR` findings — a swallowed error, a sleep in a test, a bare
   `any` in a signature, a two-bool signature, an assertion-free test,
   or a function over 80 code lines (160 in `*_test.go`; a comment-only
   line is not counted, but a trailing comment does not make its code
   line free) all stop the
   push. `MINOR` is advisory. There is no grandfathered backlog: the
   tree was cleared to zero findings before this bar was armed, so
   `make craft-static` is green and CI runs the same bar as a required
   check. A *genuine* false positive is waived in-source
   with a reason: `//craft:ignore <check> <reason>` — that is the only
   way to stand a finding down, and the reason is read by the next
   person to touch the line. The gate itself is a checksum-pinned
   binary that `scripts/craft-pin.sh` fetches on first use, so there is
   nothing to install and nothing in this repo to edit: the verdict you
   get on your laptop is the verdict your pull request gets.
3. **CI must be all green before merge**: the same deterministic gates
   plus automated review and static analysis. Address findings
   rather than dismissing them; squash-merge is the house style.

Write it right the first time: match the surrounding file, comments say
*why* not *what*, never swallow an error, and tests prove behaviour or
they are noise.

## Where things go

- Implementation decisions — anything the specification left open that
  the code had to decide — are explained in the commit message and PR
  description that makes the change; git history is the record.
- Open work lives in GitHub issues — there is no status file;
  start there, and read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the binding
  engineering rules.
- Defects and proposals go to GitHub issues, which are templated: a bug,
  a **deferred follow-up** (anything you found but deliberately did not
  fix in the change at hand — that becomes an issue rather than a
  comment in the source), a capability gap or proposal, or a
  documentation defect. Security vulnerabilities go through
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) (private reporting), never a public issue.
- **This repository is public.** Nothing you write in an issue, a PR, or
  a commit may carry a secret, customer or personal data, a local
  machine path, or a private specification path or its contents — cite
  the spec by chapter, ADR, or pin ID instead.

Margince is built contract-first: `backend/api/crm.yaml` is the
authoritative surface. No separate specification outranks the running
software, its contract, its tests and its docs — if an older document
disagrees with the tree, name the conflict and keep going. Why it is
arranged that way:
[docs/principles/the-record-is-the-code.md](docs/principles/the-record-is-the-code.md).

## Before you open a PR

- Keep the PR scoped, and let it tell a story: what, why, and how it
  was verified.
- Run the pre-submit self-check in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) →
  *Craftsmanship*.
- `make check` is green locally and every commit is signed off.
