# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# The three role images — api, web, worker — in ONE file. Every role is a
# build target (docker-bake.hcl selects it via `target`; a plain
# `docker build --target <role> .` works too), and they share the Go builder
# base below, so the stages that are identical across roles are spelled once
# and BuildKit builds them once per bake.
#
# Deployment-target-agnostic: no image bakes instance configuration. Every
# setting comes from the runtime environment (the MARGINCE_* vars in
# docs/reference/configuration.md); the api additionally reads a margince.yaml
# mounted at MARGINCE_CONFIG for first-boot bootstrap. See docs/deployment.md.
#
# The BuildKit cache mounts below pay off on a builder whose daemon outlives
# the build — the D13 Jenkins agent the deploy pipeline uses. On the release
# workflow's ephemeral runner they would start empty, so release.yml saves and
# restores their contents across runs (buildkit-cache-dance + actions/cache)
# and exports the layer cache (cache-to/cache-from type=gha, wired in
# docker-bake.hcl). A plain local build ignores all of that and still works.

# ── Go builder base (composed workspace, ADR-0120) ───────────────────────────
# The build is NOT a plain `go build`: gen-composition must run first to
# materialize build/composition/go.work (the composed workspace that folds in
# the enabled extensions/* packs); the Go binaries build under that workspace
# and the SPA lane consumes its generated registry + merged contracts. This
# mirrors `make -C backend build`. See CLAUDE.md § "make composition".
#
# The base always runs on the build platform and cross-compiles to the target:
# in a multi-platform bake only the thin runtime stages run emulated, never
# the toolchains.

# vars: the D13 ingress routes /v1 (+ /healthz /readyz /metrics) to the api
# service and / to the web one, both under the same host.
#
# The SPA has two lanes, exactly like the Go roles: a VANILLA build resolves
# the committed empty-tree registry (frontend/src/composition/extensions.gen.ts)
# and the committed contract types, and a COMPOSED build resolves the generated
# registry and the MERGED contracts under build/composition/. A shipped image
# is always the composed one — an installation's image must serve the units
# that installation enabled — which is what the gobase stage's gen-composition
# run provides.

# The pnpm version is the repository's, not the build day's. `corepack enable`
# installs the shim and nothing else: with no manifest to read, the shim
# resolves whatever npm calls latest at build time, so a new pnpm major reaches
# this image with nothing in the tree having changed. That is how this build
# went red on pnpm 12 with a green commit — the composed workspace's `link:`
# overrides resolve to dangling symlinks there and the composed typecheck
# fails on `Cannot find module 'react'`.
#
# package.json's "packageManager" is the one pin, the same field the workflows
# read. It is copied to a directory of ITS OWN because `pnpm fetch` below
# deliberately runs with no manifest beside the lockfile — see there.
#
# Nothing in this stage mounts a cache over corepack's home, and that is this
# layer's doing: a mount is not part of the image, so it would hide the version
# activated here and leave the shim resolving latest again — with, in the fetch
# step below, no manifest in /app to correct it. Baked into a layer instead, the
# pinned pnpm is simply present, and BuildKit re-runs this only when the pin

# pinned, so it is not the pnpm question.

# rather than trusting the committed schema.d.ts.
#
# gen:composed-types writes to build/composition-frontend/ — a SECOND composition
# root, because gen-composition's -verify requires build/composition/ to hold
# exactly the files it generated. tsconfig.composed.json resolves
# "@composition/schema" there, so src/api/client.ts is parameterised by the
# merged contract and an extension route is a typed call rather than a hole.
# The committed src/api/schema.d.ts is never rewritten by this build, so the
# empty-tree byte-identity the composition gates prove is untouched. (The one
# in-container overwrite that remains is public-events.ts, which has no alias
# because nothing composes it yet.)
#
# MARGINCE_COMPOSITION_FRONTEND is the runtime half of the alias (vite.config.ts)
# and tsconfig.composed.json is the compile-time half. Both FAIL LOUDLY when the
# gobase stage produced nothing: vite throws on the missing directory and tsc
# cannot resolve "@composition/extensions". A lane that skipped composition
# cannot silently fall back to the vanilla registry and ship an image that routes
# none of the installation's units.
